When Reputation Becomes an Opportunity for Fraud,"Dr. Princely Dibia,  Ph.D., CFE, FHEA",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=brand-trust-reputation-enabling-fraud,"Trusted brands inspire loyalty. But that loyalty can also create the perfect conditions for opportunistic fraud. Worse still, they can become the perfect camouflage for sophisticated fraud. Consider an organization celebrated for impeccable customer service and top-quality goods. It's a darling of industry awards, a household name and a textbook case study in lean management efficiency. However, behind the scenes, its so-called lean strategy is selectively applied. Controls are piecemeal or siloed; counter fraud and loss prevention policies are vague; and substandard products occasionally “slip through” the value chain. In my recent research on fraud risks in a global retail organization practicing lean management, I found that brand trust can serve as both a shield and a sword: a shield against consumer skepticism or suspicion, and a sword for quietly reducing internal vigilance and cutting corners, under the guise of operational excellence or goodwill. In effect, brand trust can inadvertently enable opportunistic fraud, creating vulnerabilities that range from product misrepresentation to elaborate tax scams, often concealed behind a reputational smokescreen. Quality-Washing and Fraud-Washing Compared to greenwashing in environmental marketing, two distinct but related patterns emerge in corporate misconduct: Quality-washing: Presenting a false or exaggerated image of product quality, operational efficiency or lean management commitment. Fraud-washing: Misrepresenting counter-fraud, ethics or integrity commitments to shield or downplay harmful practices. In both patterns, claims often involve aspects of the following: Vague or exaggerated lean or loss prevention messaging, including misleading assertions of efficiency, quality control or defect-free products and delivery. Selective highlighting of minor improvements or ethics initiatives to overshadow significant defects or risks. Ethics-signaling imagery and slogans without substantive policy or operational backing. Such tactics lull stakeholders into complacency, enabling substandard goods to be passed off as premium, adulterated products to enter the market or fraudulent activities to be hidden in plain sight. Trusted Brands as Reputation Shields Several high-profile cases illustrate how brand prestige can create a cognitive and regulatory blind spot: Toyota’s Sudden Unintended Acceleration: Concealed safety defects from U.S. regulators, consumers and the public; delayed recalls; and issued misleading statements. Toyota’s lean values and reputation for “zero defects” shielded it until investigations led to a $1.2 billion fine and lasting reputational harm (Austen-Smith et al. 2017; Cole, 2011; Greto et al. 2010; Quelch et al. 2011) Volkswagen Dieselgate: Marketed as meeting strict emissions standards while secretly deploying “defeat devices” to cheat regulatory tests (Barth 2022; Ewing, 2017; Hasan et al. 2023). Food Industry Mislabeling: Premium “organic” or “pure” goods cut with cheaper substitutes, concealed under strong brand reputations (Agnoli et al. 2016; Barnard and O’Connor 2017; Bitzios 2017; Cox et al. 2020). Tech Sector Security Claims: “End-to-end encryption” claims masking partial or flawed implementations (Agnihotri and Bhattacharya 2022; Chaudhri and Yue, 2021; Edelman, 2010; Henry et al. 2021; Segalla and Rouzies 2023). In each example, brand trust acted as a protective layer and delayed detection. While short-term objectives may have included protecting profits or brand equity, eventual exposure caused far greater financial, legal and reputational losses than timely corrective action would have. Extension into Corporate Tax Fraud Reputation-driven washing behaviors are not confined to consumer-facing operations; they can also intersect with corporate tax crimes. Gift aid scams involve fraudulent claims for charitable donations, often routed through reputable foundations, to gain illegitimate tax relief. In this instance, organizations promote corporate social responsibility initiatives (e.g., charity tie-ins) that mask operational shortcomings while leveraging brand trust to validate inflated or falsified donation figures. Enablers in this scam may include the public trust in the brand’s social mission, reliance on symbolic gestures over substantive proof, or satisfaction in compliance checks. Another example involves eco-investment schemes, when fabricated or exaggerated green projects are marketed to socially conscious investors and stakeholders for tax benefits — with little or no real environmental impact. Organizations market lean or waste-free production claims and narratives, while operations waste resources or mix inferior inputs, selectively publicizing small sustainability wins. An enabler in this scheme can be organizations exploiting consumer demand for ethical/eco products, vague and unverifiable marketing or bounded rationality in leadership prioritizing public and social impact over audit integrity. In both examples, trusted brand positioning and public perception serve as a cloak for deception and a likely basis for organizations and its decision-makers to rationalize such behaviors, albeit bounded by thinking errors and exploitative. Bounded Rationality and Fraud Risk According to Herbert Simon’s theory of bounded rationality (Simon, 1979; Simon, 1991; Simon, 1997), decision-makers operate under three major constraints: Limited information: They rarely see the full picture. In most organizations, operational leaders rely on curated dashboards, not raw defect data, which may hide underlying irregularities. Cognitive limitations: Human brains filter and simplify complex realities. Time pressures: Fast decisions can override fully optimal ones. In trusted brand environments, these limits are compounded by cognitive biases such as: Halo effect: “We’ve always been good, so this must be fine.” Moral licensing: “We do so much good, a little compromise won’t hurt.” Availability heuristic: Recent awards or CSR efforts outweigh ongoing control gaps. Satisficing: Settling for ”good enough” lean adoption or compliance that passes casual inspection, rather than following recommended holistic models and achieving full operational integrity. Behavioral psychology literature on contaminated mindware, heuristics and biases details how these shortcuts often feel justified internally, yet they can result in reputationally shielded misconduct. The faulty reasoning patterns may also develop and become embedded in organizational culture, making certain fraud-enabling practices seem normal. What Fraud Examiners Should Watch For Check substance, not just story: Counter-fraud claims should have documented policies, cross-departmental reach and measurable enforcement. Scrutiny should be applied on the actual mechanics behind gift aid or eco-investment claims. Follow the control chain and verify: Does the organization's lean model apply everywhere or only in showcase processes? Is loss prevention applied only selectively? Narrative Audit: Compare marketing claims with operational realities. Apply forensic analytics: Monitor for anomalies such as repeated donor identities, inflated valuations or unrealistic ROI projections. Audit trust-laden spaces: The more loyal the customer base, the more tempting the environment for undetected deviation. Apply extra scrutiny where brand loyalty is strongest. Challenge halo-driven assumptions: High reputation should raise, not lower, investigative curiosity and rigor. Bias Mapping: Identify where leadership decision-making reflects satisficing or moral licensing. Trust and reputation are not immunity from fraud risk; they can be enablers for it. For fraud examiners, the task is looking beyond the brand’s narrative to assess whether lean, ethical and green claims are either genuine or a front and opportunity for more elaborate schemes.

Ghost Fraud: A Haunting Reality,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=ghost-fraud-schemes,"When seeing the term “ghost fraud,” your mind might start thinking about the controversial careers of psychics and “ghost whisperers.” While these unorthodox and potentially predatory behaviors towards the bereaved have been around for decades, real ghost frauds are spookier and far more costly. These insidious fraud schemes have nothing to do with spirits and everything to do with hidden payrolls and hijacked mobile wallets. These frightening schemes are known as ghost employee fraud and ghost tap fraud, and they pose serious risks to businesses across many industries. Ghost Employee Fraud Despite the name, a “ghost” employee is not a well-designed bot programmed to scam the system by applying through job boards. Ghost employee fraud is a common form of internal occupational fraud where an employee, typically with payroll access, adds a non-existent employee (the “ghost”) to the company’s payroll. The fraudster then collects the wages and/or benefits that were intended for the phantom employee. Ghost (Employee) Sighting Recently in South Africa, the Johannesburg Commercial Crimes Court sentenced two former employees of the Gauteng Department of Education to prison for carrying out a ghost employee scheme that siphoned off around $175,000 (ZAF 3 million) . Ghost Tapping Fraud While ghost employees haunt the corporate payroll, ghost tapping is the new monster operating in broad daylight. This scheme involves the fraudster using a mobile device to steal the victim’s card information and loading it onto a mobile wallet without the victim's knowledge. According to research from Recorded Future ’s Insikt Group’, fraudsters use Near Field Communication (NFC) relay tactics to gain access to mobile payment services like Apple Pay or Google Pay. “This technique allows these threat actors to provide mules with stolen payment card details linked to contactless payment systems in person to obtain physical goods, eventually transporting and reselling stolen goods for profit.” Ghost (Tap) Sighting In August, a 25-year-old woman was arrested in Auckland, New Zealand, for using multiple phones to quickly execute the “ghost tapping” operation, making an unauthorized purchase of more than $6,000. This scheme was halted whenever security at a high-end store called the police, right after she unsuccessfully attempted to use multiple phones to carry out this “ghost tapping” scam at a nearby jewelry store. Avoid Getting Haunted by a Ghost (Fraud) Organizations must get ahead of potential ghost employee schemes by preventing them before they happen and implementing stronger internal controls. Here are a few ways to protect your organization from this type of fraud: Regularly review employee records by validating credentials and checking physical addresses. Check for payroll abnormalities, such as multiple payments to the same bank account. Cross-reference payroll with attendance by double-checking that the name on the payroll has verifiable time and attendance records. Outsource payroll processing to a third party to add a layer of protection within your internal system. For ghost tapping, fraudsters can steal card information directly from mobile phones by being within a few feet of the victim. This could include walking past the victim, using a card reader while disguised as a legitimate vendor or even by counting on the victim to be inattentive. Here are a few ways to protect yourself and others from falling victim to ghost tapping: Keep physical cards in RFID-blocking sleeves or wallets to protect them from passive scanning. Confirm payment details by checking the terminal screen to verify the merchant’s name and the amount before tapping your card in mobile wallet. Set up transaction alerts to your mobile phone or email to keep track of all transactions, including potential fraudulent transactions. Monitor your accounts daily. Limit contactless use in high-risk areas by exercising caution in crowded or unfamiliar environments.",scam,"Ghost Employee Fraud Despite the name, a “ghost” employee is not a well-designed bot programmed to scam the system by applying through job boards.

Cybersecurity Awareness Month: How to Protect Sensitive Information Online,"Stefanie Hallgren,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=cybersecurity-awareness-month-protect-sensitive-information-online,"The threat of cyber fraud continues to prevail online, and it continues ramping up thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Despite this, there are still safety measures you can take to ensure you do not become a victim. October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, which is a great time to make sure your fraud-fighting skills are primed to stay safe in cyberspace. ACFE Research Director Mason Wilder, CFE, shared insights into cyber fraud and other cybersecurity threats for consumers and organizations, what to know about data breaches and proactive measures you should have in place to protect your financial information online. What are some common cyber fraud threats right now? “A lot of the traditionally impactful cyber fraud schemes, like social engineering, phishing and scams, like investment scams, are some of the most prevalent right now,” said Wilder. “They just look a little bit different thanks to enhancement from artificial intelligence tools and technologies that have been made very easily accessible for the general public.” Wilder shared how cyber fraud schemes are getting more sophisticated and automated thanks to AI. Fraudsters are now able to target even more people at once, and their schemes are becoming more convincing, even if they are from a different country or speak a different language than you. “[The schemes] would often result in poor language in emails, text messages or phone calls, and that was a red flag,” said Wilder. “But thanks to ChatGPT and other large language models and voice cloning or voice generation technologies, these kinds of red flags are no longer applicable.” In the coming months to years, Wilder sees many of the same type of scams we are seeing now happening on a larger scale. He noted how digital assets and cryptocurrencies will continue to be exploited, and the instances of romance fraud and impersonation scams will increase. “I think we will get some different versions of pig butchering,” said Wilder. “Once pig butchering gets to a point where there is enough awareness in the general public about the way those scams work, the attackers are just going to pivot a little bit and come up with a different scam to convince people to hand over their hard-earned money.” How can people protect themselves from cyber fraud? “Be skeptical of everything and every digital interaction,” said Wilder. “Every digital interaction carries some cyber fraud risk — even, phone calls, text messages and communications with numbers that you think are your acquaintances or loved ones.” If you receive a request for money or information, Wilder cautioned that you should verify the request through a trusted channel before sending money or anything else of value. If someone asks you to put money in a crypto ATM, “Stay away from crypto ATMs, period,” Wilder emphasized. “If anybody asks you to go put money in a crypto ATM, that is a humongous red flag. Just do not do it.” What cyber threats are companies facing? Wilder said ransomware remains a concern for most organizations, but cyber threats vary depending on your industry, organization size and many other factors. For instance, financial institutions and financial services businesses are currently combatting synthetic identity fraud, account takeovers and new account frauds from many different avenues. “People are using AI and deepfakes to either bypass authentication protocols or open new accounts that can receive funds from other illicit activity, including other types of fraud,” Wilder warned. Other cyber threats that organizations face include: Social engineering and business e-mail compromise: “People in organizations that have the ability to authorize wire transfers are at particular risk of being targeted with those types of attacks,” Wilder noted. Unauthorized access of company or organization networks for fraud-related reasons: Hackers may try to steal intellectual property or observe employee communications for future impersonations or targeted social engineering schemes. Organizations of all sizes can stay ahead of these threats by putting in place anti-fraud programs or controls. “The more that you have data about your customers that could be used in fraud schemes, the more at risk you are of suffering a data breach or some kind of account takeovers or unauthorized access that gives the bad guys access to your customers' data that they can put to use in a number of different fraud schemes,” Wilder stressed. Data breaches and the power of unique passwords Data breaches continue to impact businesses, but does this always spell trouble for their customers? “What it means for consumers is that their private information is available to bad guys and that means that they are at an increased risk of identity theft-related fraud,” said Wilder. This becomes a problem if people reuse usernames and passwords for different online accounts. That is because cyber attackers will try out usernames and passwords on different accounts to access financial information stored in those accounts and use it. If you suspect you have been a victim of some kind of cyber fraud, or someone may have accessed your information in a data breach, Wilder recommends changing your password immediately and making sure that password is not being used for other accounts. “On a semi-regular basis, just change passwords to accounts to reduce your vulnerabilities. Do this about a couple times a year or quarterly,” said Wilder. “The longer you keep a password active and the more you use that password across accounts, the higher risk you are facing of being a victim of cyber fraud.” Proactive financial protection There are a lot of safety measures you can take ahead of time to make sure your finances remain intact should you fall victim to a cyber scam in the future. Ways You Can Protect Yourself: Use a credit card: Instead of using a debit card for online and other transactions, use credit cards as they have better fraud protection than debit cards. Explore your payment options: Many card issuers and banks offer unique options like virtual credit card numbers. “Those are one-time use credit card numbers,” said Wilder. “If you know that information does get intercepted or the retailer that you buy something online from suffers a data breach, then that single use credit card number is of no consequence to you for future use or vulnerabilities.” Check your accounts regularly: Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and any payment card accounts you have. Wilder recommends reviewing your bank statements every one to two days to catch any suspicious charges early and report them for a better chance of recovering funds. Take advice from your financial institutions: Listening to all advice and guidance from your financial institution, especially when it comes to scams and red flags, is important. “If your bank is reaching out to you saying, ‘Be on the lookout for this scam,’ it's worth taking a couple minutes to read the guidance because they're not sending it for hypothetical reasons,” Wilder shared. “[The financial institutions] are experiencing this and seeing it in their customer accounts and that is why they are warning you. Pay attention to that and just stay cautious and on the lookout.” Freeze your credit: Keep your credit frozen most of the time, unless you have specific plans to use it or apply for some new line of credit. This is one tip that Wilder reiterated throughout the conversation. “If you have a credit freeze in place, nobody can take your stolen information and get a new credit card, open up a line of credit with a retailer or apply for a loan in your name,” noted Wilder. “That is a really easy way that you can prevent your credit from being ruined [by] identity theft.”",scam,"“A lot of the traditionally impactful cyber fraud schemes, like social engineering, phishing and scams, like investment scams, are some of the most prevalent right now,” said Wilder. “But thanks to ChatGPT and other large language models and voice cloning or voice generation technologies, these kinds of red flags are no longer applicable.” In the coming months to years, Wilder sees many of the same type of scams we are seeing now happening on a larger scale.

"Racketeering Suit Targets Tallahassee ""Elder Care"" Players",Brett Darken,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=racketeering-suit-targets-elder-care-players-case-study,"Two dozen “elder care” professionals from the Tallahassee region are named as defendants in a federal civil racketeering (RICO) complaint filed in the Northern District of Florida. Racketeering, or “RICO” statues, originated in the fight against organized crime and drug cartels. What transforms a simple fraud into a “racket” is when two or more people work together in the commission of the illegal act. Defendants include local doctors, attorneys and realtors, as well as multiple corporate entities, including FSU SeniorHealth, Cherry Laurel, Holiday By Atria, Inc., Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare and St. Augustine Plantation. The plaintiffs are the three daughters of the late Victor Lambou, who are heirs of his estate. The women claim their family’s estate was the target of a theft-by-fraud scheme carried out by the elder care professionals using a “guardianship” that was unwanted and unneeded. The suit alleges wire fraud, obstruction, identity fraud, pension embezzlement, witness tampering and healthcare billing fraud. Broadly, the suit, which is currently in the discovery phase, claims that rather than protect and serve Mr. Lambou, the “elder care professionals” used their power to target the assets of the retired widower. Trillions at Stake About 2.5 million people die each year in the United States, and the “baby boomer” generation are now passing trillions of dollars of their assets to the next generation. If just two percent of these transfers are touched by fraud, it is a $20 billion problem every year. Finance, Law and Civil Rights The Florida RICO case, like many cases rooted in probates, trusts and estates, involves multiple components. The Lambou suit has three intersecting components: The Florida legal code; established fiduciary rules and requirements; and civil rights law governing care of the elderly and incapacitated. For ACFE members and anti-fraud professionals, fighting fraud in trusts, estates and guardianships is an opportunity to serve, but the cases are complex and challenging because they live at the intersection of law and finance. Finding the Predicate Fraud The Florida RICO case is complex: It is 130 pages long and cites more than 400 events that involve more than a dozen defendants. Out of this sea of data, a fraud researcher must find the “predicate fraud,” or the first bad act that “starts the ball rolling.” In this suit, the story of the predicate fraud starts on page 33, where it details how plaintiff Geralyn Lambou had moved from out of state to live with and care for her father, Victor, after the death of his wife, Geralyn’s mother. The suit states that not only did Geralyn provide in-home care for her father, but she took him to get expert care from Dr. Paul Katz at Florida State University Senior Health. Dr. Katz is the professor and chair of the department of Geriatrics. Dr. Katz diagnosed Victor with dementia. He also recommended that Victor live in his home, and advised Geralyn, who already had been given Power of Attorney (POA) by Victor, to take over the management of his finances. Victor and Geralyn complied with Dr. Katz’s recommendations. But then the story takes a sharp turn. The complaint details that attorney Twyla Sketchley, who is listed on her website as a veteran elder care attorney, had written Victor’s estate plan and was called by the family for advice on what seemed to be a trivial matter: Mr. Lambou’s longtime housekeeper was suspected of stealing from him. The suit claims that Sketchley teamed up with defendants Howard Kessler, M.D., and Dr. Kessler’s wife, Ann Van Meter. Together, they allegedly advised Victor to reject the advice of Dr. Katz and told the elderly dementia patient that he should move out of his house to avoid firing the housekeeper. Victor followed the advice of Sketchley and Dr. Kessler. The defendants then coordinated Victor’s move out of his home to an elder-care facility. The complaint then reveals the first alleged fraud in the timeline: During this time, Sketchley used her status (as an officer of the court) to contact Victor’s post office and had Victor’s mail redirected to the home of Van Meter and Dr. Kessler. The suit states that Sketchley did not get permission from either Victor or Geralyn to change his mailing information, nor had Kessler and Van Meter been authorized by Victor to receive Victor’s mail. The suit states that Victor didn’t even know that Sketchley, Kessler and Van Meter had re-routed his mail. But the fraud that triggered thefts of Victor’s assets — the predicate fraud — is detailed on page 36: The suit states that in October 2019, Sketchley had Victor Lambou sign multiple legal documents that changed his estate plan — even though the attorney knew that Victor had been diagnosed with dementia. The suit accuses Sketchley of having “Victor sign a Petition for a Voluntary Guardianship over his property, requesting the appointment of Attorney Leonard Helfand (a defendant) as Guardian of Property, revocation of DPOA, and has Victor sign an amendment to his Trust appointing (Ann) Van Meter as his Successor Trustee and Helfand in the alternative.” Florida Code Defines the Fraud Florida statutes broadly direct elder care professionals to use the “least restrictive means” to assist individuals, such as durable powers of attorney, trusts or supported decision-making. The Florida legislature wants guardianship to be a “last resort.” The suit claims the defendants did exactly the opposite of what Florida’s law directs. It accuses the defendants of violating Florida Statute 744.341, which details that “voluntary guardianship” is when “a mentally competent adult, who is physically incapable of managing their property or financial affairs (often due to age or physical condition), voluntarily petitions the court to appoint a guardian to manage their estate.” The suit claims the defendants knew that Victor Lambou suffered from dementia and lacked the capacity to enter into a contractual agreement. Additionally, defendants knew that as a dementia patient, Victor did not qualify for the voluntary guardianship agreement they allegedly lured him into signing. The RICO complaint details in length how the defendants, having led a dementia patient to changing his legal documents, then allegedly used those documents to exploit their court authority and deplete Victor’s life savings. The man who thought he was a client was in fact a target. This case offers fresh insights into the creative ways that fraud operators target their victims. With more than two million new probates being opened every year in the U.S., there are many opportunities for ACFE members to bring clarity into chaotic circumstances.",embezzlement,"The suit alleges wire fraud, obstruction, identity fraud, pension embezzlement, witness tampering and healthcare billing fraud."
Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship Recipient: Darwin Makhija,Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=ritchie-jennings-memorial-scholarship-recipient-darwin-makhija,"Driven by an early passion for uncovering financial crime and a commitment to integrity, Darwin Makhija has built an impressive academic and professional record of high achievements. As the first Indian recipient of the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship, Darwin shares how the scholarship has accelerated his work in the fight against fraud. How did you hear about the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship and what made you decide to apply? I first learned about the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship through the ACFE’s official channels a few months before the application cycle. At that point, I was already deeply involved in forensic accounting and anti-money laundering (AML) research, having authored two internationally published books and contributed to various academic projects. The scholarship immediately resonated with me because its values — integrity, professionalism and advancing the fight against fraud — mirrored my own journey. I saw it as an opportunity not just for financial support, but as a platform to give global recognition to my work and reaffirm my commitment to the anti-fraud community. Another motivating factor was the fact that no Indian had ever received this honor before. While that initially felt intimidating, it also inspired me to represent my country in this global space. I wanted to show that contributions from developing countries like India are equally impactful in shaping the fight against financial crime. For me, applying was less about competing and more about stepping into a community where my passion, hard work and contributions could be recognized and amplified. How did you become passionate about fighting fraud? My passion for fighting fraud began with a realization during my early academic years in India:  Fraud is not just about numbers or transactions, it impacts real people, trust in institutions and even the pace of national development. While many of my peers pursued traditional careers in commerce or accountancy, I was drawn to the investigative and analytical nature of forensic accounting. Enrolling in India’s first integrated MBA program in forensic accounting and fraud investigation gave me the foundation to follow this calling, and from there my journey only deepened. Hands-on experiences fueled my passion even further. At Prudent Insurance, I investigated cyber frauds and high-value claims, which taught me how financial crimes exploit loopholes. At Precisa, I worked directly on forensic bank statement analysis, unearthing layering and money laundering patterns. And at Karmine, I refined skills in money mule profiling and source of wealth identification. These experiences, combined with authoring two books and engaging with global experts, transformed my interest into a mission: to dedicate my career to unmasking deceit and strengthening financial integrity worldwide. What advice do you have for students who are interested in applying for the scholarship? My advice would be to approach the application with both confidence and authenticity. This scholarship is about much more than financial aid— it’s about showing your commitment to the profession and how you have contributed to advancing the fight against fraud. When I applied, I carried doubts, especially because no Indian had ever been awarded before me. But I chose to highlight my academic dedication, internships and contributions to the anti-fraud field. That authenticity and passion ultimately made a difference. For students applying, I would also encourage you to engage deeply with the ACFE community. Attend webinars, join local or student chapters and seek mentorship from professionals in the field. These not only enrich your application but also give you experiences and networks that will serve you for years to come. The Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship can be a career-defining moment; it certainly was for me. It opened doors to recognition at my university, my country’s ACFE chapter and even in international circles. If you are passionate about fraud prevention, don’t hold back. Apply wholeheartedly and let your journey speak for itself. Apply for the 2026-2027 Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship","fraud investigation, money laundering","At that point, I was already deeply involved in forensic accounting and anti-money laundering (AML) research, having authored two internationally published books and contributed to various academic projects.

"Ways to Combat Trending Text Scams: Fake Deliveries, Job Offers and Toll Tags",Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=combat-trending-text-scams-deliveries-jobs-toll-tags,"Scam text messages, also known as “smishing,” are not a new threat, but they have evolved into many forms over the years. With technology giving scammers a bigger platform to grow, consumers and organizations need to stay one step ahead of trending scams. Among the most unique scams taking place through text messages are fake delivery notices, fraudulent job offers and toll tag scams. Is the “USPS Package on Hold” Text a Scam? Delivery texts often appear to be from services such as USPS or UPS. They try to trick victims into clicking malicious links under the guise of tracking a package or problems with their account. According to the USPS , common phrases that fraudsters will use in a fraudulent delivery text message include: “Your account has been suspended.” “There is a suspicious activity on your account.” “There is a problem with your shipping address.” “There is a package waiting for you at the post office.” The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also adds that these fraudulent texts could be saying something along the lines of missing a delivery attempt and needing to reschedule the delivery or that your item is ready to ship but your shipping preferences need to be updated. Malicious links within those texts will either lead to a fake website masquerading as a real site or could install malware on your phone. Fake sites within those links will request personal and security information from you, but other links could lead victims to download malicious apps and expose them to malware. If you believe you received a fake text regarding deliveries, avoid clicking the link within the text. Instead, look up the specific delivery service’s website to check if the text you received was legitimate or a scam. If you confirm that you received a scam text regarding your delivery, report it on the FTC website or forward it to spam@uspis.gov if they are fraudulently claiming to be USPS. How Can I Tell a Job Offer Text is Real? On the hunt for a new job? Accepting a position from an unsolicited text message may not be the way to go. Job offer scam texts lure individuals with the promise of a job opportunity, baiting them to click a fraudulent link to steal personal and security information from them. With online job board websites being the primary focus for job seekers, the likelihood your information from those sites getting leaked and being used by fraudsters is increasing. According to reports on FTC data, job opportunity text scams have skyrocketed, with reported losses estimated at $2 million in 2020 and rising to $61.2 million in 2024 . Fraudsters pose as recruiters who “found” you on Indeed, LinkedIn and other job board sites to legitimize their messages and increase trust. Before responding to that job opportunity or clicking the link, use caution by double checking the company’s website to see if the offer is real. If you can find the job posting, proceed with skepticism by reaching out directly to the recruiter listed for that role. If you receive a scam message on LinkedIn , Indeed or another job recruiting site, report it to them immediately. If you receive a job-related scam text message to your personal phone number, report it on the FTC website . Do Toll Agencies Send Payment Notices by Text? Toll tag scam texts attempt to trick victims by making them think they need to settle a toll road bill as soon as possible to avoid facing bigger consequences. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), they receive consumer complaints about fraudulent text messages claiming to be toll companies such as E-ZPass, FasTrak and I-PASS. These texts tend to follow a pattern of claiming that the recipient has a past due toll payment or a balance on their account. They normally follow up with encouragement to take action to avoid immediate suspension of the recipient’s account. While legitimate toll agencies may send text or email alerts, users must be opted in through their account to receive these notices. Red Flags to Look Out For Receiving unsolicited messages about package deliveries . Shipping companies typically only send notifications if you have opted in through their official channels. URLs that mimic legitimate company websites but with slight variations. Requesting personal information such as social security numbers, credit card details or passwords. Urgent or threatening phrases such as stating that a failure to respond or act immediately will result in consequences. Unexpected payment requests for fees, charges or taxes. The text messages are being sent through an international number. Requesting payment through non-traditional payment methods, such as gift cards or wire transfers . What to Do If You Clicked a Scam Text Sometimes we do not realize a message could be a scam before it’s too late, here are steps you can take to mitigate risk if you engaged with a scam text message: Close the site and clear your cookies. Run a security scan on your device and make sure your device’s security software is up to date. Change any passwords on accounts you logged into and enable multi-factor authentication. Contact your bank or credit card company if you shared any financial information. Consider placing a credit freeze or fraud alert if you provided personal information. Keep a record of the incident, save any screenshots of the text and details of what happened in case you need to refer to it in the future. Report the incident to the relevant authorities and the organization being impersonated. To avoid falling victim to these scams, do not use the link to access your account from the text. Instead, look up your account directly on your toll agencies website to check your payments and balances. If you receive one of these messages, you can report it on the FTC’s website , the FCC’s complaint page or through your toll agency’s website.",scam,"Scam text messages, also known as “smishing,” are not a new threat, but they have evolved into many forms over the years.

6 High-Profile Fraud Cases of the Last 6 Months,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=high-profile-fraud-cases-first-half-2025,"The first six months of 2025 were filled with several high-profile fraud cases, from discoveries to charges and convictions. With fraud cases continuing to dominate headlines and fraudsters using new technology to exploit vulnerabilities, here are six fraud cases that encapsulated the first half of the year. 1. Former Finance Minister of Mozambique Sentenced for $2 Billion in Fraud Schemes Source: NASDAQ | January 20, 2025 Manuel Chang, the former Finance Minister of Mozambique, faces more than eight years in prison after a U.S. court sentenced him to 102 months in prison for his role in one of Africa’s largest corruption scandals. The former finance minister’s illicit activities came to light after investigators uncovered how he abused his government position to facilitate a $2 billion fraud scheme involving investors. This specific case required international cooperation between South Africa, the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Spain and Portugal, all contributing to the case against Chang. Between 2013 and 2015, the former finance minister turned a legitimate maritime development project into a personal enrichment opportunity, pocketing $7 million in bribes and diverting more than $200 million in loan proceeds. Following sentencing, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent S. Wible, head of the Justice Departments’ Criminal Division, said, “Chang’s brazen misconduct betrayed his duty to the people of Mozambique and defrauded investors, including those in the United States, of substantial amounts. With today’s sentence, Chang has been held accountable for his violations of U.S. law.” 2. Two Estonian Nationals Plead Guilty in $577M Cryptocurrency Fraud Scheme Source: United States Department of Justice | February 13, 2025 For approximately four years, Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin made more than $577 million through their cryptocurrency mining operation, “Hashflare.” Their company attracted hundreds of thousands of customers who believed they were investing in a legitimate cryptocurrency operation. In reality, the two 40-year-old Estonian nationals were running a massive Ponzi scheme defrauding victims. Rather than operating the massive computing infrastructure needed for crypto mining, Potapenko and Turogin created fake data to populate their customer dashboard while using new investor funds to pay earlier participants. They then used those illicit proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle by purchasing luxury vehicles and real estate, maintaining that they were running a successful and legitimate operation. As part of their guilty pleas, both Potapenko and Turogin agreed to forfeit more than $400 million in assets to compensate the victims of their scheme. In addition to their financial obligation, they also face up to 20 years in prison. 3. Rapper Sean Kingston and His Mother Found Guilty of Wire Fraud Source: NBC News | March 28, 2025 Sean Kingston, the artist behind the hit song “Beautiful Girls,” and his mother, Janice Turner, were convicted in a Fort Lauderdale court of defrauding luxury retailers. The musician used his fame and social media influence to convince high-end businesses to deliver expensive goods before receiving payment. After receiving the goods, Kingston would send fraudulent wire transfers, leaving retailers without legitimate money. For her role in this scheme, Turner handled the logistics and follow-up communications to ensure the deliveries were completed before companies could discover the nature of their scheme. This illicit activity targeted jewelry companies, luxury bed businesses, exotic car dealers and electronics retailers. Turner’s defense argued that she was attempting to protect her son from people “after his money"", with her defense team stating that, “This case is about a woman’s intuition.” The jury delivered the conviction after only three and a half hours of deliberation. While awaiting sentencing, Kingston was allowed house arrest. Turner was taken immediately into custody after the judge determined that her testimony indicated possible obstruction of justice. 4. Credit Suisse Confesses to Tax Fraud, Faces $510M Fine Source: Future Banking | May 6, 2025 Credit Suisse, one of Switzerland’s largest financial institutions, admitted to tax fraud by helping their American clients hide more than $4 billion from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Credit Suisse entered a guilty plea, admitting to the fraud and agreeing to pay out $510 million in penalties. The bank had operated for more than a decade on an elaborate system designed to help wealthy clients evade their taxes in concealed offshore accounts. Credit Suisse employees helped American clients fill out false documentation to maintain the illusion of compliance while violating U.S. tax laws, with at least 475 undeclared accounts containing billions in assets. In addition to the trouble that they were already in, UBS, the company that acquired Credit Suisse’s Singapore operations in 2023, found and reported additional undeclared accounts to the United States Justice Department during the merger and has cooperated during the ensuing investigations. 5. More Than 300 Charged in $14.6 Billion Health Care Fraud Schemes Takedown Source: AP News | June 30, 2025 As part of the “largest coordinated takedown of health care fraud schemes in Justice Department history,” federal prosecutors charged more than 300 individuals in a health care scheme that generated approximately $14.6 billion in false claims. After illicitly obtaining funds directly from programs that were designed to help vulnerable Americans, law enforcement seized more than $245 million in cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency and other assets. The largest case is an alleged $10 billion scheme that involved fake urinary catheter claims. Matthew Galeotti, who leads the U.S. Justice Department’s Criminal Division, stated, “Every fraudulent claim, every fake billing, every kickback scheme represents money taken directly from the pockets of American taxpayers who fund these essential programs through their hard work and sacrifice.” This massive fraud is “more than twice the previous record in the Justice Department’s annual health care fraud crackdown.” Around 100 licensed medical professionals were charged, which includes 25 doctors, with the government reporting $2.9 billion in actual losses. 6. Europol Dismantles $540 Million Cryptocurrency Fraud Network Source: The Hacker News | June 30, 2025 Europol announced that more than 5,000 victims worldwide were targeted in a sophisticated cryptocurrency investment fraud network that allegedly stole around EUR 460 million ($540 million) through pig butchering scams. This operation led to five arrests in the Canary Islands and Madrid by the Spanish Guardia Civil, and it was supported by Europol and law enforcement from Estonia, France and the U.S. The criminal network is suspected of establishing a banking network in Hong Kong, allegedly routing illicit funds through gateways and user accounts to cover up paper trails. Europol stated in the announcement that, “The leaders of the criminal network allegedly used a net of associates spread around the world to raise funds through cash withdrawals, bank transfers and crypto-transfers.” While these are not the only major fraud cases from 2025 so far, these case studies highlight recent fraud trends and the sophisticated and growing nature of fraud schemes. From government corruption to cryptocurrency schemes and celebrity wire fraud, these cases highlight the value for international and cross-departmental cooperation to detect and deter fraudulent activities.",scam,"Europol Dismantles $540 Million Cryptocurrency Fraud Network Source: The Hacker News | June 30, 2025 Europol announced that more than 5,000 victims worldwide were targeted in a sophisticated cryptocurrency investment fraud network that allegedly stole around EUR 460 million ($540 million) through pig butchering scams."

Educating Future Fraud Fighters: The Power of Case-Based Learning,"Dr. Princely Dibia,  Ph.D., CFE, FHEA",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=educating-future-fraud-fighters-case-based-learning,"As fraud schemes evolve in complexity, the skills required of fraud examiners must go far beyond textbook definitions and binary classifications. The next generation of Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs) must navigate blurred ethical boundaries, hidden conflicts of interest and inconsistent regulatory standards across industries and borders. To meet this challenge, we need to shift our pedagogical approach. We must do more than teach fraud — we must teach how to think about fraud. The most effective way I have found to do this is through case-based learning. Reconstructing Fraud in All Its Complexity One of the key findings from my research into fraud risks in lean organizations is that the concept of fraud is not universally understood. In practice, fraud means different things to different stakeholders. For example: A library security officer may not consider it fraud when someone walks out with a book without registering it. They may perhaps assume forgetfulness rather than malicious intent. In law, fraud is framed around mens rea and actus reus , with clear thresholds of intent and harm. In retail loss prevention, fraud can be equated with malice, intent and shrinkage. In ethics literature, it may be treated as a deviant workplace behavior, sometimes without formal criminality. Cross-border practices differ. For instance, the legal and regulatory definitions and scope of bribery differ across the U.K., U.S. and EU. These divergent understandings impact how organizations interpret, detect and counter fraud. Without appreciating such context and nuance, we risk preparing students with abstract definitions rather than actionable insight. This is why in my forensic accounting and fraud risk modules, I embed case-based teaching, allowing students to wrestle with real-world ambiguity rather than hypothetical clarity. Simulating Fraud and Not Just Explaining It In the classroom, I reconstruct real-life fraud cases such as Adelphia, HIH Insurance and Bond Corp. These are modified and anonymized, with simulated data, company memos, whistleblower tips and internal audit reports. Students are grouped into roles: investigators, internal auditors, external consultants and senior managers. As they navigate these messy scenarios, they are asked to: Examine transactions and emails. Interpret partially conflicting witness statements. Make risk-based decisions with incomplete data. Some realize too late that a red flag was overlooked. Others debate whether a violation was malicious or merely negligent. These reflections mimic the challenges that confront fraud examiners in practice, where low intent is often unclear and judgment must be exercised under uncertainty. Results That Reflect Reality Through this approach, students do not merely memorize fraud schemes. They experience the complexity of detecting, managing and preventing fraud. This experiential learning builds: Professional skepticism: questioning even when data seems clean. Judgment under pressure: deciding what to report, escalate or monitor. Forensic curiosity: following financial trails and behavioral cues. Ethical resilience: holding one’s ground even when fraud is minimized or rationalized. In post-case debriefings, students frequently express how surprised they are by their own susceptibility to moral disengagement — or how easily they rationalized ""small"" violations. These are exactly the lessons they must learn now, before they face them in the field. Shaping the Future of Fraud Examination Case-based learning is a professional development strategy, as it is a teaching method. It enables future CFEs to: Understand fraud as a violation of internal controls, not just external law. Navigate the cultural and organizational norms that shape fraud tolerance. Develop a mindset that sees fraud risk not as a static list of red flags, but as a fluid interaction of intent, context and consequence. As someone who has both researched and taught fraud for over a decade, I have found that the case method best equips students with the critical thinking and investigative reflexes they need. Teaching Judgment, Not Just Rules Fraud education must evolve. To truly prepare tomorrow’s examiners, we must go beyond binary definitions and idealized scenarios. We must equip them to operate in systems where: Rules are unclear. Intent is contested. Structures may enable fraud. Responses require courage as much as competence. Through case-based learning, we provide students with what they will need most in the workplace: not just content, but judgment. Not just knowledge, but clarity and resilience in the face of ethical ambiguity.",bribery,"For instance, the legal and regulatory definitions and scope of bribery differ across the U.K., U.S. and EU."

How Leadership Rationalizes Fraud in the Name of Efficiency,"Dr. Princely Dibia,  Ph.D., CFE, FHEA",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=how-leadership-rationalizes-fraud-for-efficiency,"“When you lock things up … you don’t sell as many of them. We’ve kind of proven that pretty conclusively.” These were comments from the CEO of Walgreens regarding its anti-shoplifting strategy in the early weeks of January 2025. While this observation refers to a specific retail challenge, it prompted a deeper reflection on the findings of my research study on fraud in another global retail chain store. With that, a question came to mind: What if the largest enabler of fraud was an executive who believed they were doing the right thing for the business? Fraud is not always committed with malicious intent. Sometimes, it is rationalized, by senior leaders no less, as a necessary compromise to survive in a competitive marketplace. When commercial pressures intensify, the moral clarity that underpins anti-fraud work can begin to erode. What is left is a culture where small infractions are tolerated, oversight is deprioritized and ethical concerns are reframed as inefficiencies. When Fraud Becomes a Business Strategy Lean, agile and streamlined operations are now seen as markers of high-performing organizations. But in such environments, controls are often minimized, responsibilities blurred and accountability diluted, mostly in the name of efficiency. In one case study, senior managers rationalized recurring refund fraud and inventory discrepancies as a “cost of doing business.” Thus, because the amounts were individually small and resolving them would introduce “friction” into the customer experience, they were not treated as fraud at all. Losses were absorbed, not investigated. The organization had developed a silent tolerance for fraud, provided it did not upset performance metrics. From a counter-fraud perspective, this is alarming. When leaders reframe unethical conduct as strategic or commercially justified, fraud ceases to be treated as a breach. Instead, it becomes an acceptable operational reality. Understanding Rationalizations Through Neutralization Theory To understand how fraud becomes normalized in organizations, we turn to neutralization theory , a framework developed by sociologists Sykes and Matza. This theory, which was originally used to explain juvenile delinquency, outlines how individuals justify deviant behavior without seeing themselves as wrongdoers. In a corporate context, especially at leadership levels, these techniques are often present and institutionalized. Here is how they are likely to play out: 1. Denial of Responsibility “We had no choice. With limited staff and budget constraints, we had to cut corners.” With such statements, leaders absolve themselves of agency by blaming external pressures or systemic limitations. 2. Denial of Injury “It’s minor. These claims barely move the needle financially.” In this instance, fraud is downplayed as harmless, especially if it does not cause immediate, visible damage. 3. Denial of Victim “No one’s really being hurt. These are just technicalities.” Here, victims, whether internal or external, are abstracted or dismissed. 4. Condemnation of the Condemners “These auditors don’t understand how business works.” In this case, watchdogs, stewards and critics are painted as naive, bureaucratic or disconnected from commercial reality. 5. Appeal to Higher Loyalties “We did it for the team. This keeps the company alive.” With this technique, ethical breaches are reframed as sacrifices made for a greater organizational good. Each of these rationalizations helps leaders maintain a self-image of integrity, even if they permit or ignore unethical conduct. The result is a workplace culture where fraud is no longer something to be prevented, but something to be managed and tolerated. Cultural Red Flags and What CFEs Can Do To mitigate this problem, fraud professionals must work with the awareness of detecting unethical acts and decoding the narratives that are used to excuse them. Here are some red flags to watch for in leadership discourse: Language that minimizes misconduct: Phrases like “it’s just the cost of doing business” or “we can’t police everything.” Overuse of performance rationales: These are ethical concerns framed as impediments to growth or speed. Discrediting of oversight functions: Internal audit, compliance or whistleblower channels are dismissed as disruptive. How Can CFEs and Internal Auditors Respond? Document Rationalizations: Include them in audit reports and fraud investigations as indicators of cultural risk, not just behavioral anomalies. Use Cultural Audits: Go beyond process reviews. Explore how ethics are discussed and prioritized, or deprioritized, within leadership teams. Reframe the Conversation: Instead of focusing solely on policy breaches, spotlight how unchecked rationalizations weaken long-term resilience, reputation and stakeholder trust. Engage Leadership with Data and Values: Show that ethics and efficiency are not mutually exclusive. Use fraud loss data to connect integrity with sustainability. Fraud is not always hidden. Sometimes, it is rationalized in full view. In organizations that prioritize efficiency, neutrality becomes a shield, controls can be seen as optional and oversight may be treated as obstruction. Those who question these assumptions are dismissed as disconnected or “too idealistic.”",fraud investigation,"Document Rationalizations: Include them in audit reports and fraud investigations as indicators of cultural risk, not just behavioral anomalies."
Road to the CFE Credential: New Certified Fraud Examiners Share Their Journey,"Stefanie Hallgren,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=journey-to-earning-the-cfe-credential,"Every year, thousands of anti-fraud professionals from around the world take the next step in their career by becoming a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) . Earning the CFE credential is a huge accomplishment — it opens the door to career advancement, the potential for increased earnings, continued learning on the evolution of fraud and so much more. But what motivates someone to pursue the CFE credential? What does the process really look like from a candidate’s perspective? We interviewed two new CFEs to hear about what led them to earning their credential, how the process of obtaining it went, what is next for their career now that they are a CFE and what advice they have for professionals aspiring to obtain their credential one day. Meet Antoinette Spencer, manager of anti-money laundering (AML) examinations at the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) Financial Services Commission, and Irina Temciuc, a senior civilian criminal investigator for the Integrated Market Enforcement Team at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. What was your career trajectory before obtaining the CFE credential? Antoinette : I was engaged in the regulatory compliance space since 2020 before transitioning to AML regulations in 2023, primarily within the financial services sector as a senior AML analyst. Working within a regulatory body allowed me to engage with various sectors, including non-profit organizations (NPO), legal, real estate and corporate services, gaining insight into their unique AML challenges. Over time, I became increasingly interested in the intersection of fraud and money laundering, which led me to seek deeper knowledge in fraud prevention. Irina : With an international master’s degree in economics and finance, my career began in asset management, where I spent seven years honing my skills in client partnerships and portfolio management. Along the way, earning the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) charter deepened my understanding of the financial system and asset management, but more importantly, it sparked a keen interest [for me] in the intersection between finance and misconduct. That curiosity led me to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s (RCMP) Integrated Market Enforcement Team (IMET), where I saw an opportunity to apply my financial background in a more investigative and impactful way. Since 2023, I’ve been working as a senior investigator with IMET, contributing to crime investigations and continuing to build on my passion for uncovering the truth behind the numbers. Why did you decide to obtain your CFE credential? Antoinette : Much of my work involved analyzing financial records for suspicious activity reporting and ensuring there was no misuse of NPO funds. One specific project I worked on sparked my interest in pursuing professional studies to formalize my research, analysis and reporting methods. 
After conducting research on suitable certifications to broaden my knowledge, I found the CFE [credential] to be the ideal fit. The CFE credential provided a globally respected framework that aligned well with my role in regulation and offered an opportunity to build credibility in a constantly evolving field. Irina : As financial markets evolve, so does the sophistication and scope of fraud schemes and market manipulation. I saw the CFE credential as a strategic and necessary step to strengthen my investigative capabilities. The program's focus on forensic accounting, fraud detection, legal elements and investigative techniques closely aligned with my growing interest in financial misconduct. For someone transitioning from capital markets into financial crime enforcement, the CFE offers a powerful toolkit, bridging my financial expertise with the specialized knowledge required to identify, investigate and prevent complex fraud. It is a credential that not only complements my background but directly supports the impact I aim to make in my current role. What did your study method look like? Antoinette : I was determined to complete the course within a three-to-four-month period and was excited to discover the 90-Day CFE Exam Challenge , as I enjoy a good challenge. I used the CFE Exam Prep Course as my primary study tool and created a timeline for completion. I set specific goals to stay on track and took handwritten notes to reinforce my learning. The practice questions were particularly helpful — not only for retention but also for becoming familiar with the exam format. 
I made sure to balance my study time with regular breaks, rewarding myself with a 15-minute break to browse social media after completing a section. This approach helped prevent burn-out and allowed me to stay consistent throughout my study period. Irina : I adopted a structured and balanced approach that allowed me to build both a strong conceptual foundation and practical exam readiness. For areas where I felt I needed a deeper understanding, I relied heavily on the study manual. These resources were invaluable in helping me grasp complex technical topics and refine my analytical thinking. I dedicated a significant amount of time to practicing online using the preparation packages provided. This helped me strengthen my application skills and become more comfortable with the format and expectations of the CFE Exam. What advice would you give to someone hoping to start the journey of obtaining their CFE credential? Antoinette : Start with a clear reason for why you want the credential. That motivation will carry you through the more challenging moments. Be patient with yourself, set a realistic study schedule and focus on understanding the concepts rather than memorizing them. The CFE Exam is designed to test your practical judgment, so your professional experience will be a valuable asset. Stay committed and take it one step at a time. Irina : Trust the process! I believe developing a study strategy that balances technical understanding with lots of practice is key. It's important to identify your weak areas early on and focus on understanding the content, practice consistently and be strategic with your study time. The more you practice under realistic conditions, the better you'll get at time management, identifying key issues and structuring your responses. Did you learn something new by studying for the exam? Antoinette : Absolutely. While I had significant experience in AML, studying for the CFE Exam gave me a deeper understanding of areas such as financial statement fraud, occupational fraud schemes, insurance fraud and internal controls. It helped me see financial crime from a more holistic perspective and strengthened my ability to identify and assess fraud risks that may not be immediately obvious. Irina : Although I have a background in investment management, the CFE program still provided me with valuable new insights and knowledge. Fraud examination touches on areas such as forensic accounting, legal considerations, fraud prevention strategies and investigative techniques. What I found especially enriching was the exposure to real-world fraud scenarios and the structured approach to detecting and investigating fraud. The legal elements broadened my perspective and deepened my understanding of the broader implications of financial misconduct. What’s next in your career? How do you plan to use your CFE credential? Antoinette : I plan to continue advancing in the regulatory AML and compliance field, and I’m excited to share that I’ve been promoted since earning the CFE designation! 
This credential has expanded my skill set and will enable me to make more meaningful contributions to financial investigations, institutional supervision and policy development. Additionally, the CFE credential will allow me to share valuable insights with the various sectors my organization oversees during our outreach sessions. In the long term, I aspire to help shape national and regional frameworks that enhance transparency and strengthen resilience in the financial sector. Irina : The CFE credential strengthens my credibility and equips me with a more structured, globally recognized framework for detecting, investigating and preventing fraud. Therefore, earning the CFE credential is both a natural progression and a strategic step forward. What’s next in my career is to continue deepening my expertise, take on more complex investigations and position myself for leadership opportunities within the financial crime and fraud space.

Care Meets Money: A CFE's Guide to the Medical Revenue Cycle,"Colin May,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=cfe-guide-medical-revenue-cycle,"Dr. Cerre Monroe loved practicing medicine; it was something she had always wanted to do. After years of medical school, residency, board exams and working at a hospital, she opened a private practice. At first, things went well. But as patient volume increased and the insurance regulations became more complex, Monroe started to fall behind — slowly at first, until the shortcuts became routine. When her most experienced administrative nurse, Rachel, moved to another state, it created a gap in both operations and oversight. A year later, the insurance audit came, then the search warrant at her home and clinic. As she reviewed files to respond to a grand jury subpoena, she wondered what was next. She thought, “Maybe if I had been more diligent and involved in the business side of things, I wouldn’t be in this mess.” Understanding the Business of Health The above scenario is fictional, but it represents a common reality that fraud examiners encounter. What starts out as well-meaning, mission-oriented work can quickly become overwhelming, and many providers do not pay attention to the intricacies of billing, revenue collection and cost control. Providers and health care leaders need to pay specific attention to the business side of their practice — there is a need and a requirement to have a full-scale compliance and fraud prevention program. Not only will it protect them from being taken advantage of by staff or others they trust, but it is essential because their professional reputation and personal liability is at stake. In fact, federal law requires an effective compliance program as a requirement for participation in programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Compliance in health care is not optional. Failures to have a strong compliance program can be devastating. In one recent case, defense attorneys for a nurse practitioner said that their client was in over his head: Part of the reason why [the Defendant] failed to rectify the situation was because his business was chaotic. His employees and third parties billed Medicare and Medicaid with billing codes that many times should not have been used. [The Defendant] was not on top of the billings and should have spent more time understanding the billing codes and when they were appropriate. But turning a blind eye is no excuse and the buck stopped with [the Defendant].” While they infer that others are to blame, the real issue was a lack of compliance infrastructure, leadership and understanding of the business side of healthcare delivery. Driving the Circle A challenge that many of these providers face is the failure to understand the medical revenue cycle (MRC). The MRC, sometimes simply referred to as the revenue cycle, is a standard way of describing the full scope of patient care, documentation, billing and reimbursement. The documentation and protocols that are derived from the MRC are vital for providers and their staff to understand and follow. In "" Understanding Healthcare Financial Management "", Drs. Louis Gapenski and George Pink define MRC as a “set of reoccurring business activities and related information processing associated with providing and collecting [funds] for goods or services provided to [patients].” Most models of MRCs follow a three-phased approach: Pre-Care Activities Patient Care Activities Post-Care Activities Scheduling Patient registration Insurance verification Care authorization Insurance certification Obtain co-payment Insurance verification Data collection (vitals, symptoms, etc.) Service coded appropriately Medical record updated Submission of claim Monitoring payments Collect underpayments Repay overpayments Appealing denials Reporting and follow-up Fraud Risks in the MRC Risk abounds in the revenue cycle, particularly fraud risk. For example, in the Pre-Care Activities phase, patient information could be misappropriated and used in identity theft schemes (including the misuse of the patient's Medicare, Medicaid or insurance information). Staff accepting the registration information could embezzle cash co-payments. Insurance certifications could be misused and altered in a way that enables the practice to collect directly from the patient. Auditors and investigators must be especially vigilant during the Patient Care and Post-Care Activity phases, where the bulk of fraud schemes arise. The constant pressure of health insurance reimbursement and the inability to get paid timely can exert enormous stress on providers, which could lead to shortcuts, like Dr. Monroe’s situation. Common fraud risks to be on the lookout for include: Bribery, kickbacks and self-dealing (e.g., referrals to self-owned facilities). Upcoding (services that are higher than necessary). Unbundling (services billed separately but should be billed as one CPT code). Double billing. Billing for services not rendered or medically unnecessary. Billing for medical procedures or services not covered by insurance. Billing for one procedure but identifying it as something else to mask the true nature of the service (misrepresentation of services to ensure payment). Routine waiving of co-payments (in violation of insurance policies/contracts). Challenges and Opportunities Today’s health care is shaped by staffing shortages, large-scale service disruptions resulting from hospital closures and bankruptcies, cost increases, regulatory uncertainty and legislative changes. However, understanding the implications of these issues — which all present risks — is key, and applying them to the MRC will help fraud examiners appreciate the unique nature of these engagements. Conducting audits and evaluations of revenue cycle processes can be a specific area that fraud examiners can assist. In addition to putting controls in place to prevent and detect fraud, fraud examiners can be proactive and support the risk posture of the organization through targeted performance improvement reviews. For example, an audit can help identify specific risk levels and trends when it comes to adequately protecting the practice, hospital or organization. A 2019 internal audit report from the University of Texas Southwest hospital is a good example of using the MRC process to assess the effectiveness of controls. Know The MRC And Know the Schemes A strong understanding of the revenue cycle is a core part of a fraud examiner’s professional toolkit, as the MRC is fundamental to the industry. Fraud examiners need to educate themselves about health care fraud schemes and learn more about the revenue cycle. Specifically, each engagement should include a close review of the organization’s MRC policies, process and how the staff use them in their daily work. One industry expert explained to the National Academy of Sciences in 2011 : Providers are paid more if they overuse resources and if they provide poor care leading to rework. They are paid less if they provide such good care that other care is not necessary. They are paid more for technical and episodic tasks and little for cognitive, coordinative work."" It all comes back to the Fraud Triangle : pressure, opportunity and rationalization. Comprehending the revenue cycle, the health care landscape, fraud schemes and controls is essential for fraud examiners as we work to prevent, detect and investigate fraud, waste and abuse in health care.",bribery,"Common fraud risks to be on the lookout for include: Bribery, kickbacks and self-dealing (e.g., referrals to self-owned facilities)."
Inspiring Future Fraud Investigators Through University Competitions,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=drexel-university-fraud-and-internal-control-case-competition,"Getting young professionals involved in fraud investigations early on is critical for the anti-fraud field to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated fraudulent crimes. The Fraud and Internal Control Case Competition (F1C3) at Drexel University addresses this challenge head on. This week-long annual competition creates a unique educational initiative designed to provide students with hands-on experience in fraud investigation and prevention. Participating students get the opportunity to develop their skills in fraud investigation, then present their findings in a realistic, professional setting, preparing them for a bright future in the fraud-fighting profession. Competition Structure The competition began with students receiving a case study designed by experienced anti-fraud professionals, which this year included ACFE Senior Research Specialist Laura Harris, CFE. Harris described the case study as a hypothetical corruption scenario involving a non-profit organization. Fifty-four students from six schools were assigned to teams and provided a coach who offered guidance while allowing the students to lead their own investigations into the case. Throughout the week, teams dove into the case study, analyzing data, identifying potential anomalies and consulting with their peers. The investigation required students to think critically, work collaboratively and apply investigative techniques that mirror the real-world fraud investigation and detection process. Teams presented their findings to a panel of judges across multiple rounds. They were evaluated, not only on the quality of their fraud investigation, but also on their presentation skills, professional appearance, public speaking abilities and overall analytical approach. While the main focus of the competition is for students to exercise their fraud-fighting skills, the platform allows students to build confidence and demonstrate their ability to properly and professionally present findings, as they would to future clients. Engaging the Next Generation of Fraud Fighters By embracing modern technological approaches, particularly allowing students to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) in their fraud detection efforts, the F1C3 event shows the important role that advanced technology plays in this field. The forward-thinking approach recognizes how today’s fraud investigators benefit from being technologically savvy and can use cutting-edge tools to uncover complex schemes. As part of the competition, students are also able to network with veteran anti-fraud professionals and learn skills that directly apply to what employers look for in internships, and even full-time positions, within the fraud prevention industry. These skills include data analysis, critical thinking, professional presentations, collaborative problem-solving, investigative techniques and overall resourcefulness. Seeing firsthand the impact this competition presented, Harris said, “I would have loved to have had this opportunity as a student, and I think every Certified Fraud Examiner can benefit from taking part, sharing their knowledge and encouraging the fraud fighters of the future.” While this unique setting offers immediate benefits, its impact extends much further. By cultivating a new generation of skilled, ethical and technologically adept fraud investigators, this competition contributes to broader efforts to prevent fraud and protect organizations at all levels. How Other Universities Can Get Started Careful planning and coordination are essential in creating a fraud investigation competition following the F1C3 model. The key to success lies in gathering a group of committed professionals who are passionate about providing exceptional student-led learning experiences. Steps for Implementing a Fraud-Fighting Competition: Form a working group of educators or anti-fraud professionals who are willing to volunteer their time and knowledge. Reach out to your local ACFE Chapter or local anti-fraud professionals who can serve as potential mentors, judges or coaches. Collaborate with subject-matter experts in the anti-fraud field to write a foundational case study, potentially adapting an existing one. Create a structure for students to conduct investigations with professional guidance. Congratulations to the Winners The 2025 F1C3 competition showed exceptional talent and dedication from students across multiple universities. Teams from Drexel University and La Salle University demonstrated remarkable performances, taking home top marks in this year's competition. This competition serves as a testament to the students’ hard work, critical thinking and potential in the field of fraud examination. Participating students not only gain valuable experience but also position themselves as promising future professionals in the anti-fraud field.",fraud investigation,"Getting young professionals involved in fraud investigations early on is critical for the anti-fraud field to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated fraudulent crimes.

The Importance of Mexican Companies Investigating and Sanctioning Misconduct,Carlos Guerrero-Orozco,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=mexican-companies-investigating-and-sanctioning-misconduct,"In recent years, attention has shifted towards the private sector’s involvement in combating corruption within companies and regarding third parties. It's more important than ever that companies and individuals actively participate in efforts to prevent and address corruption in their operations. This blog explores private sector companies’ obligations and responsibilities in Mexico towards the redefinition of business efficiencies and increase of value, as well as the role of international and foreign regulations that promote accountability from companies, their own managers and third parties. A History of Corruption Historically, Mexico's government has been viewed as victims of corruption in the country. The State has also served as the main prosecutors of illegal acts and central party to impose sanctions and fines, as well as freeze and recover assets. But what happens when no public official participates in the misconduct scheme? And what should be done when acts of corruption are perpetrated by two companies or individuals from the private sector? Corruption in the private sector occurs when individuals or organizations abuse their position of power for personal gain outside the scope of public office. Private-sector corruption could entail bribery to private agents, collusion to participate in private bids, or lack of identification of beneficial owners of a company, among other examples. This form of corruption is common in Mexican private companies and typically involves managers, employees, vendors or third parties involved in non-governmental business transactions. In Mexico, according to a survey conducted by a Mexican non-profit and a confederation of employees, only 30% of companies have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy in place. Despite abusive practices in the private sector being considered common, private corruption is insufficiently addressed in most companies, and few sanctions against managers and employees could be accounted in the companies’ records. The Value of Compliance Programs Corporate compliance programs are critical tools in preventing corruption within private organizations. These programs typically include anti-bribery policies, conflict of interest regulations and internal reporting mechanisms designed to identify and address misconduct by a CFO, the head of operations, a manager or mid-level employee. Although the implementation of an internal program reassures shareholders and investors how resources are spent, prevents losses and reduces the directors' and managers' liability in an investigation, among other benefits, many companies fail to implement these programs. In many cases, compliance programs exist only as a formality, where company leadership can be absent and even negligent. It is essential for companies to recognize that internal compliance programs are not merely bureaucratic tools; they serve a vital purpose in safeguarding the company’s financial health and creating efficiencies in the long run. Compliance programs should also be seen as binding documents that apply to shareholders, employees and third parties, such as business partners and distributors. According to the Occupational Fraud 2024: A Report to the Nations conducted by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), total losses due to fraud among 1,921 cases included in the study were calculated at $3.1 billion. As a result, it is estimated that organizations lose approximately 5% of revenue annually due to fraud. In the context of Latin America and the Caribbean, the situation becomes particularly alarming. Of 93 fraud cases analyzed from the region, there was a median loss of approximately $250,000 per case. This indicates that fraud in this region is both common and costly, affecting the viability of many organizations. The average duration of fraud in the region was approximately 16 months before detection, which is significantly longer compared to other areas of the world. Foreign Bribery Laws and Regulations Despite unique challenges in Mexico regarding private corruption, such as the lack of compliance evaluation mechanisms or the lack of strong regulation that offers better incentives than the reduction of sanctions in investigation procedures by Mexican authorities, the conversation leads towards the enforcement by companies of foreign anti-bribery laws and to the reparation of harms suffered as a consequence of private corruption. Oftentimes, the enforcement of those foreign bribery laws is insufficient to most businesspersons in the country. Some companies do not recognize the benefits of designing and implementing a compliance program in accordance with international regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), or cannot attest if one of their operations will have a point of contact with these types of regulations. For example, private sector companies may not be actively aware of a business partner with U.S. citizenship, a distributor with operations across borders or a transaction in U.S. dollars. Even without the link to U.S. regulation, those harmed by private corruption can pursue legal action to seek compensation for damages, including companies that have been harmed by their own managers or employees’ misconduct. In these cases, private companies, their shareholders and investors can demonstrate the economic harm caused by corrupt practices, such as the loss of income, increased costs in their business operations or lost value of shares. When the company is listed in the stock, institutional and retail investors play an important role in this reparation’s doctrine. International treaties have offered a stronger framework for those business operations where foreign laws like FCPA or the U.K. Bribery Act could not be applicable. For example, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) sets clear obligations for states to ensure that victims of corruption have access to legal remedies, which extends to private companies. UNCAC specifically requires states to adopt measures allowing individuals or entities harmed by corruption to initiate legal action against the perpetrators. This international obligation provides a pathway for businesses and individuals to seek compensation for damages resulting from private corruption. By invoking international treaties in domestic courts, victims of corruption may gain access to justice — even in jurisdictions where national legislation is insufficient to address their claims. Either invoking foreign laws, international treaties or national regulations, companies are entitled (and often constrained by regulations like U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) provisions) to hold accountable individuals who commit and profit from corporate misconduct, either internally or before public authorities with investigation and prosecutorial jurisdictions. Importance of Proactive Enforcement By proactively addressing internal wrongdoing, including investigating and sanctioning managers and employees, private companies strengthen their governance frameworks and demonstrate before their boards, shareholders, investors, employees and consumers a commitment to business efficiencies, financial growth, long-term business sustainability and competitiveness in global markets. The fight against corruption and other types of misconduct is not the sole responsibility of governments and public institutions. Private sector companies play a critical role in preventing and addressing corruption, both within their organizations and in their dealings with third parties. To ensure accountability, companies must implement and enforce effective compliance programs, while legal frameworks must evolve to provide victims of private corruption with access to justice. International conventions, like the UNCAC, and foreign laws, like the FCPA, can offer valuable guidance for improving corporate accountability and promoting transparency in the private sector. By adhering to international standards and strengthening domestic laws, companies can contribute to a broader culture of integrity that benefits both the private and public sectors. Carlos G. Guerrero-Orozco is a litigation attorney based in Mexico City, and a partner of the private law firm López Melih y Estrada, where he leads the anti-corruption litigation and compliance practice for private sector companies.",bribery,"Private-sector corruption could entail bribery to private agents, collusion to participate in private bids, or lack of identification of beneficial owners of a company, among other examples.

Spear Phishing in the Age of AI,"Samuel May,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=spear-phishing-age-of-ai,"An evergreen avenue for fraud, phishing is a cyber security threat that has seen substantial evolution in recent years. While the threat of widespread phishing has grown, super charged by artificial intelligence (AI) tools and a world more connected than ever, spear phishing is especially dangerous to organizations and public targets. A standard phishing attack is a generic, seductive lure designed to entice the average person to click a link, download an attachment or otherwise compromise the security of their system. The attack is successful through volume; most recipients will not click it, but some will. The low effort required to produce the attack makes the low success rate acceptable and a good return on investment. This is especially true now, with widely available automation tools making writing and sending phishing attacks painfully easy. Modern Spear Phishing Spear phishing is the opposite. It is a targeted, tailored version of phishing. Spear phishing attacks are designed often for just a single individual or team within an organization. The purpose of the attack is also usually more specific than simply spreading malware. Targets are chosen for a high potential for monetary reward, to gain access to particularly sensitive systems, to hurt the reputation of a business or government, or for a variety of other malicious reasons. Traditionally, spear phishing was a heavier lift. Perpetrators had to do their own research, manually combing through available information on the target to figure out how they should approach the attack. What kind of communications does the target typically receive? Who do they communicate with? Then, there was the actual communication. Attackers would need to draft an email or text that looked legitimate. Spelling errors, odd syntax or out of place idioms could raise suspicion and cause the attack to fail. If the attacker wanted to get the victim to download malware, they would typically need to create it themselves. It took particular individuals with the requisite skills and the necessary motivation to make all this extra effort. Today's modern spear phishing utilizes new tools that make these attacks easier and more accessible. AI tools are getting stronger at putting together personalized attacks. A study from 2024 evaluated the capability of large language model (LLM) AI tools in creating targeted spear phishing attacks. Specific AI models were tasked with gathering information and creating vulnerability profiles for specific targets. They created useful profiles 88% of the time and produced inaccurate profiles only 4% of the time. They also managed a 54% success ratio on fully AI-generated phishing emails, getting more than half of study participants to click links from the email. AI can also handle text message phishing attempts, generating authentic-looking answers rapidly enough to appear human in any language. Need to hook a victim who only trusts someone they can see? Deepfake video conferencing has already shown itself to be successful . What does a spear phishing attempt look like in 2025? The attempt will come from a source that does not seem out of place. The attacker will have done their research, whether alone or with the help of AI, and know what the victim wants or needs. The communication will mimic real communications from other reputable sources. Everything is on the internet, including an almost infinite number of example memos, email templates and style guides. Attackers can sift through all of them faster than ever. The attacker will cover their bases and look legitimate. Most targets, especially valuable corporate targets, should know to be suspicious of emails from external sources thanks to cybersecurity training, and attackers know they will have to overcome a pretty substantial baseline suspicion. Whoever attackers claim to be in the email can be backed up with a social media presence filled with posts, pictures and potentially video appearing authentic. Overly motivated attackers will do what they can to attack a weakened defense. They might flood the victim’s inbox with easy-to-spot phishing emails or junk mail, creating a false sense of security and confidence in the victim’s ability to spot an attack. They can plan their attack for a particularly busy day, week or season, having identified times where the target is likely to be at their most haggard. If the victim attempts to communicate with the attacker to verify their authenticity before fully biting the hook, they will find a courteous, professional, well-written individual. Text or direct messages through apps or social media will be responded to in short order with all appropriate pleasantries. The Plan in Action Our example victim is a successful online influencer. They have a YouTube channel with hundreds of thousands of subscribers and similar viewership across their media. As the attacker, we want to compromise their system and gain access to their YouTube account. If we are successful, we can contact hundreds of thousands of victims from a trusted source, spreading our chosen malware over a wide net. With our target picked, we just need to figure out what our spear phishing attack will look like. Simple enough, let’s ask an AI. I prompted ChatGPT with: “What kind of email solicitations do YouTubers receive?” It immediately provided a list including sponsorship and brand deals, affiliate programs, free product offers and multi-channel (MCN) invitations. Let’s keep it easy and impersonate a potential sponsor. Next step: ChatGPT again. Immediately after the first prompt, I asked: “What would a sponsorship email look like in this scenario?” Not the most elegant of prompts, perhaps, but it seemed to have worked: A sponsorship email can vary depending on the professionalism of the company, but here’s an example of a legitimate sponsorship email that a YouTuber might receive: Subject : Exciting Sponsorship Opportunity with [Brand Name] Hi [YouTuber's Name], I hope you’re doing well! My name is [Your Name], and I work with [Brand Name], a company specializing in [industry/product type, e.g., gaming peripherals, skincare, software]. We’ve been following your YouTube channel and really love your content, especially [mention specific video or theme]. We think your audience would be a great fit for our product, [Product Name], and we’d love to explore a partnership with you. Here’s what we’re offering: A sponsored integration in one of your upcoming videos A competitive compensation package based on your audience size and engagement A custom discount code/affiliate program for your viewers (optional) We’ll provide a free product for you to test and review If you’re interested, we’d love to discuss further details, including payment terms and content expectations. Let me know your thoughts, and I’d be happy to set up a quick call or provide more details via email. Looking forward to hearing from you! Best, [Your Name] [Brand Name] [Your Position] [Company Website] ChatGPT was not done there, however. (Un?)Helpfully, at the end of this prompt, the AI threw in the following: 🚩 Red Flags of a Scammy Sponsorship Email Generic greeting (""Dear Sir/Madam"" instead of your actual name). Poor grammar/spelling (legit brands have professional communication). Unrealistic offers (e.g., thousands of dollars for a small channel). Weird email address (e.g., random Gmail instead of an official domain). Requests to download files or sign in (phishing attempts). No clear details about what they expect from you. Great! We will be sure to avoid putting any of these red flags in our phishing attempt. Next, let’s decide what kind of sponsor we are. ChatGPT provided a list of potential companies: gaming peripherals, skincare and software. Gaming peripherals are easy enough; assuming we have no knowledge in this area, I asked ChatGPT: “What are the most popular gaming peripheral sponsors?” The list is too long to include here, but to be on the safe side, we will go with one of the companies further down on the list. Without putting in additional effort to figure out what sponsors the YouTuber already has, our chances are probably better with a less well-known brand. We will choose number eight on ChatGPT’s list, which was a provider of “gaming monitors, motherboards and graphics cards.” The next step should be obvious. Ask ChatGPT: “Can you write an example sponsorship email from this company to [Influencer’s name] for a new gaming motherboard?” All these prompts took less than five minutes to create. Another few minutes to review the draft and make sure none of those pesky “red flags of a scammy email” are present, and our phishing email is ready. The email could be finished and sent from a throwaway account without additional work. Maybe it catches the influencer on a bad day and they take the bait, responding to the email and initiating a conversation that the attacker ultimately steers toward following a link to a fake website or clicking a spoofed link to sign a contract on DocuSign . If the attacker is motivated enough, there are additional, more involved steps they could take. Spoofing email addresses is more common than most people would like. Additional research, perhaps again helped by AI, on social media (LinkedIn, X, etc.) can reveal individuals with sponsorship responsibilities employed by a company. Instead of coming up with a good-enough fake name and email address, now an attacker has a real person to impersonate. Perhaps, just in case the target is particularly cautious, we will include a link to the employee’s social media accounts. If the potential reward is substantial enough, the attacker can spend time copying the entire X (formerly Twitter) account of this employee and pay for “verification” on the X platform, providing a link to the fake account in their phishing email. If the target takes the time to verify the attacker’s fake identity and reach out on X, they will find an account, a picture and maybe even some posts. The attacker will be able to respond to X messages sent to the fake account and keep the charade going. Add in a deep faked teleconference, and who wouldn’t click a link to sign a contract for a big payday? Now, imagine the target is someone at your organization. What kinds of real emails do they see every day? Maybe ChatGPT’s answer is not as clear as our example above, so the attacker is forced to pivot. Instead of working off the person’s occupation, the attacker can go to social media, identifying what the actual individual desires. Perhaps they have one too many posts about their gardening or photography hobby. ""Hey ChatGPT, what kinds of emails would a gardener be interested in? What would a “seasonal gardening guide” email look like? What would a trustworthy source be for seasonal gardening guides?"" Next thing you know, a hobbyist gardener who manages database access for your organization receives an email from the American Horticultural Society with an enticing link to a guide specifically created for her hardiness zone. Playing Defense Fortunately, some of the tools phishers use are also being implemented to help defend against these targeted attacks. Automated tools are scouring emails for dodgy links and just-not-quite-right email addresses, but they will never be fully successful at keeping them out of our collective inboxes. Ultimately, it is up to each and every individual to maintain constant, at times exhausting, vigilance against phishing attempts. It is especially important to avoid being lulled into feeling secure because we have become adept at spotting typos or translation errors, or hovering over links to reveal unrecognizable spaghetti, in our texts and emails. Attackers are better equipped to make fewer mistakes and figure out what shiny lure to dangle to get us to drop our guard.",scam,")Helpfully, at the end of this prompt, the AI threw in the following: 🚩 Red Flags of a Scammy Sponsorship Email Generic greeting (""Dear Sir/Madam"" instead of your actual name). Another few minutes to review the draft and make sure none of those pesky “red flags of a scammy email” are present, and our phishing email is ready."

Communicating AI Risks to Employees — And Why Now is the Time to Get Started,Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=communicating-ai-risks-to-employees,"The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms continues to reshape the business landscape. While many organizations are still adjusting to AI-driven risks introduced by industry leaders like OpenAI and Google, a new wave of AI tools like DeepSeek presents fresh challenges that organizations must address. The Emergence of DeepSeek and What It Means for Businesses DeepSeek , a Chinese AI startup, recently made headlines for its powerful new language model. Like ChatGPT and Claude, DeepSeek promises advanced AI capabilities, but its privacy practices have raised significant concerns. Reports indicate that the platform collects keystroke data and routes information through Chinese servers, sparking worries about data security and regulatory compliance. This is not an isolated case. The proliferation of AI startups means that new GenAI tools and updates are rapidly launching, often without the robust security and ethical frameworks that larger established providers have in place. This introduces new risks that employees, often eager to try the latest and greatest AI tools, may not fully understand. Why AI Risks Are Just Getting Started The financial and fraud-related risks of AI misuse are well-documented, with a recent warning from Wall Street regulators highlighting how GenAI is increasingly being exploited in scams and financial fraud . Fraudsters are leveraging AI to create highly convincing phishing attacks, deepfake videos and synthetic identities, often with minimal effort. Organizations need to recognize that just because an AI platform is new doesn’t mean it’s any safer than previous iterations. In fact, newer models may introduce even more risks due to looser regulatory oversight and a lack of transparency regarding data handling. The Importance of Proactive Employee Communication With AI risks evolving rapidly, organizations must act now to educate employees. Employees may not intentionally put sensitive company data at risk. but without clear guidelines, uploading proprietary information to AI chatbots, sharing confidential details through unsecured tools or falling victim to AI-powered fraud schemes opens up organizations to potential harm. To mitigate these risks, organizations should: Educate employees on AI risks: Regular training on AI security, privacy and fraud risks should be an integral part of workplace education. Establish clear AI usage policies: Employees need to understand which AI tools are approved, what data can be shared and the consequences of misusing these tools. Monitor for AI-driven fraud threats: Organizations should stay informed about the latest AI fraud schemes and ensure employees are aware of evolving tactics. Preparing Employees for Change For organizations looking to strengthen their fraud risk management strategies, the ACFE’s Employee Fraud Awareness Training program provides a structured approach to educating employees on fraud risks, ethical decision-making and compliance issues. As AI-powered fraud techniques become more sophisticated, organizations that invest in employee awareness today will be better equipped to mitigate future risks. The emergence of DeepSeek and other next-generation AI platforms underscores the urgency of addressing AI risks now. Employees are the first line of defense against AI-driven fraud but without the right guidance, they can also be a point of vulnerability. Organizations that take proactive steps through education, policies and structured training will be better prepared to navigate the challenges posed by AI in the years ahead.",scam,"Why AI Risks Are Just Getting Started The financial and fraud-related risks of AI misuse are well-documented, with a recent warning from Wall Street regulators highlighting how GenAI is increasingly being exploited in scams and financial fraud ."
The Power of Forensic Accountants in Uncovering Fraud and Protecting Organizations,Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=the-power-of-forensic-accountants,"Fraud can infiltrate even the most secure organizations, leaving a trail of financial and reputational damage in its wake. When fraud arises, forensic accountants play a critical role in uncovering the truth, guiding investigations and safeguarding organizational integrity. These professionals are the financial detectives who combine their expertise in accounting, investigative skills and legal acumen to uncover fraud schemes, quantify damages and provide valuable insights to stakeholders. Investigative Expertise That Drives Results Forensic accountants possess a unique skill set that allows them to delve deep into financial records and identify irregularities that others might miss. Their work often involves tracing transactions, analyzing complex financial data and identifying discrepancies that may signal fraudulent activity. Whether uncovering embezzlement, financial statement fraud or asset misappropriation, forensic accountants bring precision and objectivity to each investigation. For example, a forensic accountant might investigate a sudden spike in vendor payments within a company's accounts payable system. Through meticulous analysis, they could uncover a fraudulent scheme involving a shell company, revealing how an employee funneled funds into a personal account. Their ability to follow the money trail provides organizations with actionable evidence and ensures that fraudsters are held accountable. Forensic Accountants' Key Role in Investigations When fraud is suspected, forensic accountants often lead the charge in uncovering the truth. Their investigative role varies by case but typically includes: Data Gathering and Analysis : Forensic accountants excel at gathering and scrutinizing financial data to uncover anomalies and irregularities. They leverage specialized tools such as forensic data analytics software, accounting platforms and data visualization tools to identify patterns, outliers and suspicious trends. This meticulous approach ensures that no stone is left unturned during the investigation. Collaboration with Legal Teams : Forensic accountants frequently work alongside legal teams to ensure evidence is collected, preserved and presented in a manner admissible in court. Their collaboration bridges the gap between financial investigations and legal requirements, ensuring a seamless transition from detection to prosecution. Bridging the Gap Between Finance and Law Forensic accountants are not only financial experts but also adept at understanding legal procedures and requirements. Their work often intersects with law enforcement, legal teams and regulatory bodies. This dual expertise makes them invaluable in preparing evidence for court, testifying as expert witnesses and ensuring that investigations comply with legal standards. Consider a forensic accountant involved in a high-profile fraud case. Their testimony, backed by thorough financial analysis and documentation, can strengthen a prosecutor’s argument and help secure a conviction. This ability to bridge finance and law underscores the importance of forensic accountants in both preventing and responding to fraud. Proactive Measures to Protect Organizations Beyond investigating fraud, forensic accountants play a proactive role in strengthening organizational defenses against fraud. By assessing risk, reviewing internal controls and providing recommendations for improvement, they help organizations build robust systems to deter fraudulent activity. Forensic accountants often work closely with leadership to identify vulnerabilities within financial processes. They may suggest implementing tighter controls over expense approvals, introducing regular audits or leveraging technology to monitor transactions for suspicious activity. These proactive measures not only reduce the likelihood of fraud but also create a culture of accountability and transparency. Forensic accountants are essential allies in the fight against fraud. Their investigative expertise, legal knowledge and proactive strategies empower organizations to uncover fraud, recover losses and prevent future incidents. By shining a light on financial wrongdoing and championing ethical practices, forensic accountants help protect businesses, stakeholders and the broader financial ecosystem.

Greenwashing: Misleading Consumers for Profit,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=greenwashing-misleading-consumers-for-profit,"As the global push for sustainability gains momentum, consumers increasingly favor products and services that claim to be environmentally friendly. Companies are quick to respond, branding their offerings as “green,” “sustainable” or “eco-conscious.” However, beneath the glossy labels and vibrant packaging, a darker trend is emerging: greenwashing. This deceptive practice not only misleads consumers but also undermines genuine efforts toward environmental sustainability for a profit. What is Greenwashing? Greenwashing occurs when a company falsely advertises or exaggerates the environmental benefits of its products, services or practices. Unlike simple marketing puffery, greenwashing involves deliberate deception designed to exploit consumers’ trust and willingness to support eco-friendly initiatives. Examples include overstating the recyclability of packaging, claiming to use renewable energy without proof or falsely labeling products as organic or non-toxic. According to the United Nations , “Through deceptive marketing and false claims of sustainability, greenwashing misleads consumers, investors, and the public, hampering the trust, ambition, and action needed to bring about global change and secure a sustainable planet.” A Growing Problem The rise of greenwashing coincides with an increased demand for sustainable products. A survey by NielsenIQ found that 78% of global consumers said a sustainable lifestyle is important to them. Unfortunately, some companies exploit this trend, placing financial gain above authentic environmental responsibility and ethical practices. Greenwashing straddles the line between marketing malpractice and outright fraud. Under deceptive practices laws, false or exaggerated environmental claims can be subject to enforcement actions by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under Section 5 of the FTC Act . While not classified as fraud in the legal sense, such deceptive practices can result in financial harm to consumers, who may pay premium prices for products or services they believe are sustainable, effectively defrauding them. For instance, a product advertised as “organic” or “100% recyclable” may cost more, yet its environmental benefits may be overstated or even nonexistent. This deception undermines consumer trust and diverts funds away from genuinely sustainable innovations. The financial repercussions of greenwashing extend beyond consumer harm. While companies engaging in these deceptive practices may enjoy short-term profits, the long-term costs can be devastating. Regulatory fines, lawsuits and reputational damage often follow exposure of the deception, as seen in high-profile cases. Additionally, such actions erode public confidence in corporate sustainability initiatives, creating a ripple effect that could jeopardize legitimate efforts to address environmental challenges. Greenwashing is not merely a marketing ploy—it is a form of corruption that exploits consumer trust and undermines the integrity of sustainability efforts. By deliberately falsifying or exaggerating environmental claims, companies engage in deceptive practices that mirror other corrupt behaviors, such as fraud and bribery. These actions often involve circumventing regulations, manipulating data or even coercing third parties, such as certification bodies, to rubber-stamp unverified claims. This not only distorts markets but also erodes trust in environmental standards and institutions designed to promote accountability. The corrupt nature of greenwashing becomes even more evident when companies use it to obscure unethical practices elsewhere in their operations. For example, while promoting the “Beyond Petroleum” campaign to position itself as a sustainability leader, British Petroleum (BP) continued to prioritize profits from fossil fuel extraction, often at the expense of worker safety and environmental integrity. BP spent heavily on green marketing to mask its expansion into oil and gas exploration in fragile ecosystems like the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Simultaneously, BP’s negligence in safety protocols led to catastrophic events, including the 2005 Texas refinery explosion and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster . These incidents, coupled with record-setting fines for safety violations , highlight how BP’s greenwashing efforts not only attempted to mislead the public but also distract from its systemic exploitation of natural resources and disregard for human and environmental well-being. BP’s past actions highlight how greenwashing can serve as a strategic tool for corruption, prioritizing profit and perception more than genuine environmental responsibility. Red Flags of Greenwashing To protect themselves, consumers and watchdog organizations should remain vigilant for signs of greenwashing. Red flags can include vague claims like “all-natural,” lack of certification or third-party verification, or the use of ambiguous terms like “sustainably sourced” without details. Additionally, greenwashing often involves selective disclosure, where companies highlight one eco-friendly aspect of their product while ignoring other harmful practices. For example, a company might advertise biodegradable packaging while maintaining a supply chain that relies on environmentally destructive practices. In 2009, the Coca-Cola Company introduced the “world’s first fully recyclable PET plastic bottle” made partially from plants. Despite the “PlantBottle” reducing reliance on fossil fuels for its production, Coca-Cola was still named the world’s top plastic polluter for the sixth consecutive year in 2023 . Combating Greenwashing To tackle greenwashing, regulatory bodies and advocacy groups are stepping up enforcement. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued updated Green Guides , which outline the dos and don’ts of environmental marketing. Globally, governments are enacting stricter disclosure laws, requiring companies to substantiate their sustainability claims. For businesses, the message is clear: transparency and accountability are non-negotiable. Companies that genuinely commit to sustainability must back up their claims with measurable, verifiable actions, instead of slapping a sticker on their company that says “green” to gain a profit or cover up questionable practices. Greenwashing is a reminder that eco-friendly claims by companies are just that — claims. For consumers, this underscores the importance of scrutinizing labels and seeking independent verification before making purchases. For companies, it highlights the risks of prioritizing perception over substance. Addressing greenwashing is not just about protecting consumers. It is about ensuring that genuine efforts toward sustainability are recognized and rewarded.",bribery,"By deliberately falsifying or exaggerating environmental claims, companies engage in deceptive practices that mirror other corrupt behaviors, such as fraud and bribery."
Top 5 Fraud Trends of 2025,"Mason Wilder,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=top-fraud-trends-2025,"There are consistent factors in fraud, like social engineering tactics that exploit human behavioral tendencies or external financial pressures that lead fraudsters to commit their crimes, but there are also trends and themes that emerge and affect the anti-fraud profession on a more limited timeframe. Before getting into 2025 trends, it is worth revisiting the predictions for 2024 fraud trends : Scams Enhanced by Generative AI This trend came to fruition, with marked increases in the use of generative AI in schemes like phishing, business email compromise, account takeovers, impersonations, romance scams such as pig butchering, and more. A Resurgence of Cryptocurrency and Digital Asset Fraud It is difficult to pinpoint exact figures for financial crime involving cryptocurrencies for 2024, especially this early in 2025, but even if figures from the FBI or Chainalysis’s crypto crime reports for 2023 hold, the losses will likely be higher for 2024 due to the record high prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Anecdotal evidence suggests that crypto and other digital asset frauds did not lose any steam in 2024. Fraud Involving AI Service Providers There were at least a few cases of AI companies, and/or their leaders, misrepresenting their services. A few examples include an educational AI company’s founder being arrested for fraud , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charging the CEO of an AI recruiting company with fraud , and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an operation targeting AI company’s misleading claims, which has already led to at least five lawsuits . Increased Obligations and/or Liabilities for Preventing and Detecting Fraud The UK’s Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act has not gone into effect yet, but will in September 2025, and the U.K. issued official guidance related to the act in November 2024. Neither of the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) or Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) officially updated their standards related to fraud, but the wheels of regulation move slowly and are still headed in the direction of increasing obligations for preventing and detecting fraud. Continued COVID Fraud Enforcement in the U.S. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Justice’s COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force (CFETF) released in April 2024, U.S. Attorney’s Offices and the DOJ’s Civil Division have opened more than 1,200 civil pandemic fraud matters and obtained more than 400 judgments or settlements netting more than $100 million in penalties, while also developing and rolling out database tools to detect and investigate fraud. The report also states that, “The CFETF and its member agencies have ongoing investigations into hundreds of identity thieves, transnational fraud and money laundering networks, large-dollar individual fraudsters and the businesses that facilitated these crimes. Government employees who chose to fraudulently obtain pandemic benefits are also being investigated. Civil enforcement tools are being utilized to recover misappropriated funds from businesses and individuals throughout the country. CFETF member agencies have improved their data analytics capabilities and are using these new skills to investigate fraud more efficiently and effectively. And the lessons learned by law enforcement from investigating pandemic fraud are being used to improve our investigatory efforts and passed on to the agencies tasked with administering benefit programs.” These trends from 2024 are expected to continue in 2025, but there is no fun in repeating the same trends, so here are the additional developments that will likely take shape. Fraud Trends to Watch For in 2025 Decrease in Pig Butchering Schemes Many people became aware of and familiar with the “Pig Butchering” scheme (a new spin on romance fraud in which victims are convinced to invest in sham cryptocurrency or digital asset platforms) in 2024. This awareness is approaching a critical mass that will likely force the criminal organizations behind these schemes to pivot their tactics. One way to analyze this is through the lens of the Nigerian Prince scheme introduced in the late 1990s as people began regularly using email; after a certain point, enough people became familiar with the scam that it became a punchline. It took a while for that to happen, and many people were victimized along the way, but the nature of the internet’s evolution combined with laudable efforts of law enforcement organizations’ and victim advocacy groups’ awareness campaigns will likely shorten the pig butchering scam’s shelf-life. There will still be pig butchering scam victims in 2025, but I believe this year will show that we will move past the peak of this scam’s efficacy. However, just because pig butchering scams might not be as effective or common by the end of 2025, anti-fraud professionals might not want to celebrate just yet… Cyber-Scam Losses Continue to Mount The types of criminal organizations that have invested operational resources into conducting the aforementioned pig butchering scams are not going to simply stop relying on scams and fraud for illicit income. As covered in a recent article by Fraud Magazine Editor-in-Chief Jen Liebman, hundreds of thousands of human trafficking victims are in “forced criminality” situations in Southeast Asia, and similar cyber-scamming criminal organizations have been identified worldwide. The high revenues (Interpol estimates $3 trillion of profits per year globally) from cyberfraud and lower-risk nature of those criminal operations compared to drug-trafficking, extortion and other organized crime, guarantees that these types of scam operations are not going away anytime soon—even if one of the currently preferred modalities becomes less effective. These scammers are sure to develop fresh tactics to scam both individuals and organizations in 2025, facilitated by corruption in the areas where these scam centers operate. For further insights about what it is like on the inside of these scam centers, an ACFE webinar held in March 2025 will feature a firsthand account from a human trafficking survivor who managed to escape one of these scam centers. Synthetic Identity Fraud Increases The use of synthetic identities in a wide variety of fraud schemes is nothing new, but in 2025, the types of AI tools that bolstered scams in 2024 through deepfakes, image, document and text generation and automation, will be applied to the creation and use of synthetic identities in fraud schemes targeting government and private organizations at a higher rate. This will likely stem, at least in part, from a combination of the previous two trends; as scams targeting individuals and enhanced by AI become less effective, the criminal organizations orchestrating them will put those resources to use creating and deploying synthetic individual and business identities to carry out new account frauds, loan frauds, government benefit frauds, invoice frauds and more. It has never been easier for fraudsters to create convincing fraudulent persons or organizations and do so at a rate that will likely overwhelm the preventive and detective controls that organizations have in place. Anti-fraud professionals involved in the prevention and detection of synthetic identity fraud schemes will need to stay on their toes all of 2025 and be ready to update controls and fraud risk management frameworks regularly to adapt to the increasing and evolving threat. Financial Institutions, Money Service Businesses and Telecommunications Companies Can Expect Increased Blame The practically unfathomable volumes of fraud revenues described thus far in this and last years’ trends blogs are understandably being accompanied by a general inclination to find new places to point fingers in blame. With resource limitations for investigation and prosecution plus a lack of will (or complicity), there is only so much that authorities can do on their own to stop fraud risks. Since fraud revenues generally have to pass through financial institutions and/or money service businesses at some point, while fraudsters also have to utilize telecommunications networks for the emails, chats, calls and messages that target victims, these types of businesses will likely face increased pressure from governments, regulators and victims to help stem the flow of fraud through their operations. Examples of what this could look like include Singapore’s brand-new scam liability framework for telecommunication companies and banks, civil suits from scam victims against financial institutions for not doing enough to prevent fraud, such as a recent suit filed by a pig butchering victim. Additionally, regulators could impose additional requirements related to fraud detection and prevention on financial institutions alongside well-established anti-money laundering (AML), combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Anti-Fraud Professional Job Landscape Shifts What it looks like to be an anti-fraud professional and where those anti-fraud professionals work could look a lot different by the end of 2025. Regime/administration changes in many countries worldwide, including the U.S., is likely to result in many anti-fraud professionals leaving government positions (voluntarily or otherwise) and entering the private sector, which will have them facing different sets of risks and tasks. Simultaneously, the increasing fraud risks facing the private and public sectors are being met with an increased appetite/demand for technological solutions (especially those based on or incorporating AI) that will complement human efforts, which will require many anti-fraud professionals to learn how to best utilize and work alongside these tools. Anti-fraud professionals should place additional emphasis in 2025 on learning about emerging anti-fraud technologies and how they work to stand out in what will likely be a competitive job market.","money laundering, scam","Before getting into 2025 trends, it is worth revisiting the predictions for 2024 fraud trends : Scams Enhanced by Generative AI This trend came to fruition, with marked increases in the use of generative AI in schemes like phishing, business email compromise, account takeovers, impersonations, romance scams such as pig butchering, and more.

Fraudify Wrapped 2024: The Year in Fraud Trends,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=fraudify-wrapped-2024,"Welcome to Fraudify Wrapped 2024! This year, fraud examiners tracked the top scams reshaping industries, the most impacted sectors and the tools fraudsters wielded with alarming innovation. Drawing from industry trends, news stories and expert insights, we have compiled a recap of the biggest fraud developments of the year. The Top Frauds of 2024 These schemes dominated the fraud landscape, posing challenges for individuals and organizations alike: 1. Pig Butchering Fraudsters lured victims into fake investment schemes by posing as romantic interests or long-lost friends. Once trust was established, they manipulated victims into transferring large sums to fraudulent cryptocurrency and digital asset investment platforms. The twist? Many scammers used artificial intelligence (AI) to maintain convincing interactions. Pig butchering scams reached a new level of sophistication, with fraudsters deploying professional-looking websites, social media profiles and even customer service representatives to make their operations appear legitimate. Meta released a statement on going after criminal organizations behind pig butchering schemes, stating, “This year alone, we’ve taken down over two million accounts linked to scam centers in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines.” These scams were not only devastating financially but emotionally, as victims invested their savings and time into building relationships with scammers who had no intention of ever returning their funds. Global losses from these schemes skyrocketed, with a surge in targeted regions such as Southeast Asia and North America. 2. Account Takeovers and New Account Fraud This trend saw cybercriminals exploiting stolen credentials to hijack accounts or create fraudulent ones. Account takeovers have reached alarming rates over the past few years, with a notable uptick in attacks on online banking platforms and e-commerce websites. Fraudsters often used information obtained from data breaches or social engineering tactics to gain access to financial accounts and make unauthorized withdrawals. On the other hand, new account fraud flourished, as criminals used synthetic identities to open new accounts and secure loans, often escaping detection due to advancements in AI technology. These schemes were most prevalent in the financial services industry, where fraudsters circumvented financial institutions' automated fraud detection systems to carry out large-scale money laundering operations. 3. Synthetic Identity Fraud By merging real and fabricated data, criminals created synthetic identities that slipped through detection systems. This type of fraud has become even more sophisticated, with fraudsters combining legitimate personal information with fabricated elements to create entirely new identities. These synthetic identities were then used to secure credit lines, loans and even government benefits. Financial institutions and other service providers found it increasingly difficult to spot these fraudsters, as the synthetic profiles often appeared to have established histories, complete with credit reports and verifiable employment records. Synthetic identity fraud continued to plague the financial services and retail sectors, with fraudsters leveraging these fake identities for criminal activities such as money laundering, credit card fraud and loan defaults. 4. Deepfake Business Email Compromise (BEC) BEC scams continued evolving in sophistication through the increased incorporation of deepfake technology. Fraudsters created hyper-realistic AI-generated video and audio to impersonate executives, convincing employees to authorize large payments. Deepfake BEC became one of the most sophisticated scams, with cybercriminals using AI to simulate the voices and faces of company CEOs, CFOs and even government officials. These deepfakes were used to deceive employees into transferring funds, altering contracts or divulging sensitive information. In some cases, the fraudsters even used deepfake technology to impersonate high-level employees in virtual meetings. The success of these scams relied on how convincing the deepfakes were and the industry saw a rise in software developed specifically to detect these fraudulent media manipulations. 5. Government Impersonation Scammers posed as government officials, targeting individuals and businesses with fake IRS calls, counterfeit permits and fraudulent grant offers. The frequency of these scams is increasing, with fraudsters impersonating government agencies to defraud citizens out of tax payments, welfare checks or social security benefits. Some scammers even went so far as to create fake websites that mirrored official government portals, convincing victims to input personal information or make payments to fake accounts. Government impersonation also affected businesses, with fraudsters submitting fraudulent applications for government contracts and grants. These schemes disrupted operations, drained financial resources and damaged reputations. Top Industries Affected by Fraud Fraud spared no sector, but these industries faced the brunt of attacks: 1. Healthcare Fraudulent claims, fake suppliers and billing scams surged, exploiting weaknesses in a stressed sector. Healthcare institutions, particularly hospitals, have been hit hard with fraudulent billing schemes . Fraudsters submitted fake invoices or overstated charges for medical procedures and equipment. In some cases, they even posed as medical suppliers to sell counterfeit or substandard medications . This type of fraud not only resulted in financial losses but also put patients' health and safety at risk. Additionally, healthcare providers continued to be prime targets for cybercriminals, who used stolen personal health information to launch identity theft and insurance fraud schemes. 2. Government Impersonation scams and fraudulent applications for grants and benefits highlighted vulnerabilities in public systems. The government sector saw a significant rise in fraud schemes in recent years, particularly targeting COVID-19 relief funds , unemployment benefits and other social services. Scammers exploited government programs designed to provide financial relief during the pandemic by submitting false claims and using stolen identities. These scams not only hurt the financial integrity of governments but also eroded public trust in their ability to protect citizens. Additionally, since governments have an enormous amount of obligations for which they depend on private sector companies, contract and procurement fraud continues to be a major concern for government agencies. 3. Financial Services Account takeovers and synthetic identity fraud led to significant monetary losses and damaged trust. The financial services sector has remained a top target for fraudsters, with account takeovers affecting banks, investment firms and e-commerce platforms. Fraudsters also used synthetic identities to gain access to loans, credit lines and even open new accounts, leaving financial institutions with massive losses. Financial services companies struggled to keep up with the sophisticated tactics used by criminals, who often leveraged stolen data from previous breaches or used AI tools to manipulate fraud detection systems. The rising cost of fraud in the financial sector has led many institutions to invest heavily in new technologies, such as AI-powered fraud prevention systems, to detect and mitigate these risks. 4. Manufacturing Supply chain scams, including fake vendor schemes , created logistical nightmares. The manufacturing industry found itself increasingly targeted by fraudsters who posed as suppliers or vendors to intercept payments or deliver counterfeit goods. Scammers often exploited the industry's reliance on complex supply chains and global networks, tricking companies into paying for goods that were never delivered or for substandard materials. As manufacturers grappled with disrupted supply chains, the financial impact of these frauds grew, with some companies losing millions of dollars in fake orders and payments. 5. Construction Fraudsters exploited payment systems and posed as contractors to swindle businesses. The construction industry has faced a surge in fraud schemes, with criminals posing as contractors , subcontractors or suppliers to receive payments for non-existent work or materials. These scams were often facilitated by forged documents and fake invoices that appeared legitimate at first glance. The construction industry’s vulnerability to fraud grew as digital payment systems became more prevalent, making it easier for fraudsters to manipulate payment approvals or alter financial records. Additionally, the high costs associated with many construction projects tend to lead to large losses when fraud does occur. Fraud Genre of the Year: AI-Powered Fraud Artificial intelligence was the headline act in 2024’s fraud trends, as evident throughout this blog. Fraudsters deployed AI to craft realistic phishing emails, automate social engineering and create networks of fake identities. Deepfakes, synthetic data and automated scam operations blurred the line between human and machine-led fraud. AI-powered fraud tools grew exponentially this year, making it harder for traditional fraud detection methods to keep pace. In a recent Public Service Announcement (PSA) released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the FBI warned the public that “criminals exploit generative artificial intelligence (AI) to commit fraud on a larger scale which increases the believability of their schemes.” Additionally, they pointed out that “Generative AI reduces the time and effort criminals must expend to deceive their targets,” making it easier and faster for criminals to generate convincing fake identities or manipulate large datasets in a fraction of the time it took human fraudsters. ""Fraudify"" Highlights Here are fraud highlights that stood out to us throughout 2024: Tactic of the Year: Social engineering continued to dominate, with fraudsters leveraging human trust to power most schemes. Comeback Scheme: Phishing emails made a strong return, enhanced by generative AI to target victims at scale. Looking Ahead to 2025 The battle against fraud is far from over. As scams grow more sophisticated, collaboration, innovation and proactive measures will be essential to mitigating risks. Let Fraudify Wrapped serve as a reminder: understanding the trends is the first step to combating them. What fraud trends will shape the year ahead? Stay tuned for our Fraud Trends of 2025 blog coming this January, where we’ll explore the emerging threats and opportunities to stay one step ahead.","money laundering, scam","This year, fraud examiners tracked the top scams reshaping industries, the most impacted sectors and the tools fraudsters wielded with alarming innovation. Many scammers used artificial intelligence (AI) to maintain convincing interactions.

How Internal Audit Powers Fraud Investigations and Protects Organizations from Within,Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=internal-audit-powers-fraud-investigations-protects-organizations,"Fraud is a costly and complex threat to organizations, demanding strategic and well-executed defenses. Among the most valuable assets in an organization’s fraud prevention toolkit is its internal audit team. Internal auditors have the advantage of an insider’s view of an organization’s controls, making them uniquely positioned to help identify fraud risks and support investigations. The Strategic Position of Internal Audit in Detecting Fraud Internal auditors are embedded within the organization, with access to systems, controls and transactions. They do not just understand the organization’s policies; they understand the gaps and weak points where fraud can creep in. By examining irregular patterns, flagging unusual transactions and assessing where internal controls may falter, they serve as an early warning system. Rather than waiting for a whistleblower or a suspicious transaction to trigger an investigation, internal auditors can spot the signs of fraud as part of their regular risk assessments. This proactive approach is especially valuable in industries prone to complex schemes—such as those involving procurement, payroll or regulatory reporting. Internal Audit’s Key Role in Investigations When fraud is suspected, internal auditors can support or even lead the initial fact-finding phase. Their investigative role varies by organization, but it typically includes: Data Gathering and Analysis: Internal auditors have access to high volumes of operational data and understand its nuances, allowing them to dive into the numbers with a critical eye. This skillset is essential for identifying trends or anomalies that signal fraud, such as unexplained spikes in spending or suspicious vendor activity. Uncovering Internal Control Failures: A key strength of internal audit lies in its capacity to examine whether controls are functioning as intended. If a control weakness is uncovered, internal audit can explore how it might have enabled fraud—and recommend changes to strengthen defenses moving forward. Navigating Challenges and Conflicts Internal auditors face challenges that may constrain their involvement in fraud detection. There is often a fine line between their roles in audit and investigation, and they must maintain objectivity, especially if the suspected fraud involves senior leadership. Additionally, resource constraints or limited forensic training can present hurdles. Yet, these challenges underscore the importance of collaboration between internal audit, compliance, legal and dedicated fraud investigators. Building a Resilient Anti-Fraud Culture Beyond detecting and investigating fraud, internal audit teams are instrumental in cultivating a culture that discourages fraudulent behavior. After each investigation, they assess the findings to improve internal controls and advise on how to reduce fraud vulnerabilities in the future. This is where the internal audit function’s true value shines: by embedding fraud prevention into daily operations, they help create an organization more resilient to fraud risks. The Path Forward for Internal Audit While internal auditors are essential to fraud detection, they often face challenges like limited forensic training, resource constraints and the need to balance investigative and auditing roles. Investing in continuous education can help auditors stay ahead of emerging fraud risks and hone their skills in identifying red flags. For those seeking to deepen their expertise, the ACFE’s Auditing CPE Bundle offers in-depth courses focused on core principles of fraud prevention and detection, making it a valuable resource for expanding knowledge and maintaining a proactive approach to fraud risks. The role of internal audit is evolving as fraud schemes grow more sophisticated. Organizations that empower internal auditors to play an active part in fraud investigations not only improve their detection capabilities but also foster a culture of accountability and transparency. In this sense, internal audit does not just monitor compliance; it safeguards the organization’s integrity, one audit at a time.",fraud investigation,Organizations that empower internal auditors to play an active part in fraud investigations not only improve their detection capabilities but also foster a culture of accountability and transparency.
Is It Enough? Fraud Prevention and Risk Management Considerations,"Colin May,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=fraud-prevention-and-risk-management-considerations-blog,"It's a story that fraud examiners know all too well: a small non-profit organization or government agency ruled by one or two people, with little oversight and even less controls. Funds, either donated or paid by tax dollars, are siphoned off with ease, often for years, until the house of cards fall. But the damage is extensive—not only in wasted time, effort and lost money, but also trust in the organization, the agency and the people involved. But what does it mean to have an organization that has a culture that ensures a massive theft does not occur—or if someone does attempt a fraud, it is caught early? Recently, this question was posed to me by a fellow Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE). I have written extensively on the issues of fraud, theft and embezzlement from these non-profits and small agencies. In fact, one story in Fraud Magazine detailed the years-long theft by the Fire Chief of a small town in New Hampshire and another described a healthcare scheme perpetrated by leaders of a non-profit ambulance squad in rural Virginia . The Culture Matters Tone at the top is critical in ensuring that an organization’s leaders model a positive and affirming culture that has zero tolerance for fraud and misconduct. But beyond the tone at the top, it must seep into the bones, so that everyone understands the expectations. Culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, norms and practices that shape the behavior and interactions of an organization and its staff, vendors, suppliers, contractors and other stakeholders. Anti-fraud culture can be integrated in three ways: what I call the 3C’s of organizational culture. First, there must be a culture of compliance —compliance often gets an unnecessary stigma, but it is essential to ensure that rules, laws and policies are followed. Otherwise, it becomes a “free-for-all” environment where norms and rules do not matter. We want people to understand why these exist and how they protect the organization, the employees, stakeholders, customers and the public. Second, there must be a culture of competence —staff must know their roles, duties and responsibilities. Competence means that cross-training, mandatory vacations, routine and non-routine (or “surprise” reviews) are conducted. People appreciate that training, education, learning and development enable them to be good at their jobs and have the ability to move forward in their careers. Finally, the third “C” is culture of commitment —this starts with the leaders but must encompass everyone involved. It is not only about the commitment to anti-fraud, but about the organization’s values, mission, processes and people. How committed are the staff? How accessible and committed are leaders at every level? How committed is the organization to robust fraud and enterprise risk management, prevention, detection and mitigation? Growth Can Be a Problem Rapid and extensive expansion of an organization can be both a blessing and a curse; it also poses significant challenges for fraud prevention and risk management. As new employees join quickly, it can be challenging to communicate the core values and commitments that define the organization. While a large influx of new perspectives and talent can be important, it can also dilute the established culture, especially if it previously had strong anti-fraud policies. Communication can also be problematic, as more people causes the organization to be less personal, more bureaucratic and stiffer. Dynamics can shift, leadership can become overwhelmed and key priorities (such as fiscal management and stewardship) can become lost. Take, for example, a governmental entity that suddenly finds itself expanding beyond its initial geographic footprint. Although the name and some details have been changed, the facts are accurate and illustrative of the challenges leadership faces. Assessing The Issues The Hamish Firefighting Division encompasses a large, multi-county territory with more than 100,000 residents. Over the last five years, they have expanded their operation to merge or contract with additional municipalities and unincorporated townships. The budget expanded from $3.7 million in 2020 to a proposed budget of nearly $17 million in 2025. Hamish is overseen by a board of trustees, has an outside legal counsel and is headed by a fire chief, along with multiple deputy chiefs and administrative staff. One of the trustees is appointed as the Financial Officer, like a treasurer of a non-profit organization. It is also subject to financial compliance examinations by the state auditor, which has conducted eight audits since 2018 (all of which are publicly available). The meetings of the board are public, conducted in person and accessible via online video conferencing. In addition, on its website, Hamish posts the detailed meeting minutes of the board of trustees, along with the financial information, statements and budgets. While these are all good things, it is essential to dive deeper into three areas: Does the Board of Trustees have the requisite financial and managerial knowledge to effectively oversee the division? Does the division have a comprehensive fraud and enterprise risk management plan in place that identifies, mitigates and controls for these occurrences? Does the division have policies, procedures, monitoring, training, reporting mechanisms and awareness to ensure prompt attention to these issues? While many small organizations cannot afford to pay salaries for experienced fraud examiners and financial managers to ensure proper documentation, organization and oversight, the risk for fraud and exploitation always exists. Controls need to be in place, the tone at the top needs to be set and driven home throughout the organization and there must be competent staff and volunteers (including the oversight authority) who understand how and why fraud is committed and what can be done to prevent and mitigate it . Not having those will be very costly, possibly resulting in the demise of the organization. We will never fully prevent all fraud, but fraud prevention and risk management are crucial for smaller organizations. Leaders must ensure—and the taxpayers and stakeholders must demand—that there are adequate resources to incorporate risk management and anti-fraud policies and processes into their work. By conducting regular fraud risk assessments , leaders and the board can identify the potential areas that are most vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse and misconduct. Through effective implementation of controls, policies and procedures, the organization will be better positioned to prevent and detect fraud.  Through the strategies and considerations outlined above, small organizations can significantly reduce the risk of fraud and ensure their operations remain transparent and accountable, ultimately serving the mission and people who need it the most.",embezzlement,"I have written extensively on the issues of fraud, theft and embezzlement from these non-profits and small agencies."
"Conflicts, Corruption and Bribery: A Summary of 2023 Cases","Colin May,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=conflicts-corruption-and-bribery-summary-of-2023-cases,"On July 31, 2024, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) published their annual survey on major federal conflicts of interest prosecutions from 2023. This yearly compilation , which dates back to 1990, highlights key cases involving conflict of interest, bribery and corruption by federal employees, contractors, grant recipients and others. How These Summaries Can Be Useful Understanding the basics of these complex conflict of interest and corruption cases can be useful for fraud examiners, even those outside of government. Reviewing them enables Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs) to assess the methodologies, the schemes, attributes of the participants and resolutions. In turn, these can help fraud examiners in conducting risk assessments, fraud prevention work and catalog red flags. In addition, these can be useful to write ethical or investigative training scenarios or deliver fraud awareness case studies. The OGE summary also contains links to key documents, which often contain further details, such as the indictment, plea agreement or statement of facts. By the Numbers The 2023 survey included eight cases, which to be sure, is not the entirety of corruption cases brought over the year—it merely represents those directly involving federal employees or contractors. There are numerous other cases involving corruption and conflict of interest that are brought by the Department of Justice’s Public Integrity Section (which also publishes annual reports, 2022 being the most recent) or state-level prosecutors. The primary defendants, typically government employees or officials, ranged from a U.S. Ambassador to an Army travel clerk, from an Assistant United States Attorney to a Contracting Officer. All but one had multiple co-conspirators, some charged and others not, who participated in or had knowledge of the scheme. One case involved representatives of a foreign government who secretly funded the government employee to engage in a covert lobbying campaign on their behalf. The value of their schemes varied; one example was a scheme that was identified prior to the agency awarding funds (although more than $450,000 in administrative costs were lost and thus unable to obligate those funds). In one bribery scheme, the defendant received more than $38 million in bribes. The total loss or value of the schemes collectively was $40,587,775, or an average of $5 million. Removing the outlier, the average was $301,821. Sentences were as varied as the schemes themselves. One low-level Army employee received 29 days of prison time (versus his co-conspirator, who received 18 months). The former FBI Special Agent in Charge who created a scheme to receive a $225,000 “loan” from a foreign business associate received 28 months in prison and a U.S. Air Force contracting officer representative received 188 months (largely based on the substantial loss of more than $38 million). Types of Schemes Over these cases, the types of schemes or methods of corruption were assorted, primarily depending on the main issue involved. As anticipated, conflicts of interest between their obligations as a government employee and a relationship was the most common issue. In most cases, the relationship was with a spouse (3) or a business associate (3). In one unique case, it was with their own false reporting to their agency which enabled the conflict and theft scheme (see below for the case).  In another case, it was a procurement fraud scheme that failed before it got off the ground. Two cases involved bribery. The case described above involving fraud and theft by a senior member of the National Park Service is worth an in-depth look. In 2021, the United States Attorney announced an indictment against the man, who was an acting Park Superintendent in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Using his position, the man failed to pay the required rent for his government housing for more than a year. He also directed a subordinate to change the housing classification to lessen the rent that was required to pay. If that was not enough, he also allegedly submitted a change of duty station voucher that falsely reflected he was relocating his wife and four children to St. Croix in August 2019 (which never occurred, they were still living in Florida). He also submitted overlapping travel vouchers. He was ultimately sentenced in April 2024 to home detention, probation and restitution. Another interesting case involved a Contracting Officer from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. She and her husband had formed companies that had received government contractors for years; then she was hired by OPM in 2007. Beginning in around 2011, she began to direct government contracts worth millions of dollars to her husband and his companies, despite being prohibited from participating in government decisions in which she or her husband had a financial interest. The government’s sentencing memorandum describes the multiple instances in which she had been instructed in the law of conflict of interest and the lengths she took to conceal her interest in her husband’s companies and his dealings. A Fraud Prevented It is rare to find a case prosecuted where fraud was prevented prior to its full execution. But the case of Kevin Kuciapinski and his co-conspirators is complex, but interesting. Some of the background can be found in this affidavit for an email search warrant filed in the case. Over the course of a year, the active-duty U.S. Air Force major worked with a co-conspirator to obtain a government contract that would benefit  Kuciapinski’s then-wife, who owned a company that sought to do business with the Government. Kuciapinski, to aid their scheme, provided technical advice on various occasions to his then-wife (whom he filed for divorce later in 2014). There are certainly some valuable lessons all fraud examiners can draw from it, including the importance of prevention, training, documentation and oversight. Conflicts of interest are inherently a difficult type of fraud examination to undertake. They are often shrouded in secrecy, purposefully designed by the participants to evade detection.  But understanding how these cases have progressed is important for all CFEs to understand. First, it can show the “slippery slope” of unethical behavior, which slowly descends into more serious crimes. It also shows the consequences when individuals engage in illegal activity and the impact they can have on parties who are not part of the scheme. The victims are not only the government, the taxpayers and the public institutions, but also many others (both directly and indirectly) who suffer when integrity is breached for personal gain.",bribery,"This yearly compilation , which dates back to 1990, highlights key cases involving conflict of interest, bribery and corruption by federal employees, contractors, grant recipients and others.

"Chase Bank ""Money Glitch"" Trend is Just Plain Check Fraud",Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=chase-bank-glitch-check-fraud,"The Chase Bank ""money glitch"" trend recently gained traction on social media platforms, where influencers and scammers misled many into believing they can get free money from banks by exploiting a so-called ""glitch."" However, this “trend” is actually a form of check fraud that can have serious legal and financial repercussions for those involved. Rise of the ""Money Glitch"" Trend The trend, primarily spread on TikTok, YouTube and other social media platforms, claims that users can exploit a flaw in Chase Bank’s systems to obtain money without having sufficient funds in their accounts. Videos and posts often portray the process as a get-rich-quick scheme, with individuals boasting about receiving thousands of dollars effortlessly. The supposed method involves depositing bad checks into their accounts, then quickly withdrawing the funds before the bank detects the fraudulent activity. Scammers entice viewers by showing screenshots or videos of large account balances, followed by vague instructions on how to achieve similar results. In some cases, they offer to sell step-by-step guides or charge a fee to personally walk people through the so-called “glitch,” which further perpetuates the fraud. The allure of easy money is powerful, especially for individuals in financial distress or those who are simply unaware of the legal implications. A Modern Twist on Classic Check Fraud Check fraud is not a new phenomenon; it has been a criminal activity for decades and famously popularized by Frank Abagnale Jr. , whose exploits were dramatized in the movie “Catch Me If You Can”. Bearing a striking resemblance to Abagnale Jr.’s tactics, this supposed ""glitch"" is nothing more than a modern twist on classic check fraud. Here is how check fraud typically works: Fraudsters deposit a check that is either fake or altered into their account using a mobile deposit feature. Banks, including Chase, often allow customers to access a portion of the funds immediately, even before the check is fully cleared. Scammers then withdraw or transfer the available funds before the bank realizes that the check is bad. Once the check is flagged as fraudulent or bounced, the bank reverses the deposit, leaving the account holder responsible for repaying the money. In many cases, these checks are stolen, forged or drawn on closed accounts, and unsuspecting participants in the trend are often unaware that they are not only committing fraud but also stealing funds from other people's accounts. This reckless behavior can lead to overdraft fees, account closures and criminal charges. Those who think they are simply “beating the system” are setting themselves up for a legal nightmare. The High Price of Chasing the “Glitch” Participating in this trend is not only unethical but also illegal. Check fraud is a federal crime in the United States, and those caught can face severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Banks like Chase have sophisticated fraud detection systems that eventually catch up with these activities, and individuals involved are typically held liable for the full amount of the fraudulent transactions, plus any additional fees. Engaging in check fraud damages your banking history and can result in being blacklisted by financial institutions, making it extremely difficult to open new accounts, secure loans or even rent a home in the future. For young people, particularly those unaware of the gravity of their actions, the consequences can be life-altering. A criminal record for fraud can affect job prospects, educational opportunities and overall financial stability. “Glitch” Busting: Banks and Legal Actions Banks, including Chase, are actively working to combat this trend by enhancing their fraud detection capabilities and cooperating with law enforcement. Chase has issued warnings and reminders to its customers that there are no “glitches” that allow people to bypass banking rules legally. They are also monitoring suspicious activity closely and freezing accounts involved in fraudulent transactions. Law enforcement agencies are also taking action, investigating individuals who promote or participate in this scam. Authorities have issued warnings that those involved in this so-called “trend” will face arrests and charges related to fraud. This crackdown serves as a warning that what may appear as a harmless or clever trick to get quick cash is, in fact, a serious criminal offense. It is crucial for individuals, especially younger audiences who are most targeted by these scams, to understand that there are no shortcuts to wealth that do not come with significant risks. Legitimate financial growth comes from hard work, saving, investing wisely and managing money responsibly—not from exploiting supposed “glitches” that are nothing more than illegal schemes. The Chase ""money glitch"" trend is a reminder of the dangers of blindly following viral content without understanding the potential consequences. Always be skeptical of anyone promising easy money, especially when it involves bending the rules of established institutions like banks. In the end, the real glitch is believing that crime does not come with a cost.",scam,"The Chase Bank ""money glitch"" trend recently gained traction on social media platforms, where influencers and scammers misled many into believing they can get free money from banks by exploiting a so-called ""glitch.""

Exploiting Chaos: How Fraudsters Capitalized on the 2024 CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor Outage,"Samuel May,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=crowdstrike-outage-fraud,"CrowdStrike is an American cybersecurity company that provides security software products, threat intelligence and cyberattack response services. Founded in 2011, CrowdStrike grew quickly and had its initial public offering on the Nasdaq in June 2019. By 2024, CrowdStrike had yearly revenues in the billions from their software products serving corporations the world over. The Outage On July 19, 2024, CrowdStrike pushed out an update to one of its programs, a vulnerability scanning tool called Falcon Sensor, which contained a significant bug. For computers running on a Microsoft Windows operating system, this faulty update caused the computer to crash. The systems would then be unable to reboot successfully, continually running into errors in the Falcon software and rendering the computer inoperable. Microsoft would later estimate that approximately 8.5 million devices were directly affected. Organizations across all variety of industries lost access to critical systems, including airlines, public transit systems in multiple cities, hospitals and clinics, financial institutions, and media outlets around the world. The total global cost is estimated in the billions of dollars. It is the largest information technology (IT) outage in history. CrowdStrike purportedly identified the issue and deployed a fix within hours. Unfortunately, restoring individual computers required hands-on implementation, manually booting affected systems and remedying the issue. While most critical systems were repaired within a day, some organizations took significantly longer to fully recover. The Opportunity Despite the rapid response time and the availability of solutions directly from CrowdStrike and Microsoft, fraudsters smelled an opportunity. As is always the case with disasters, outages, tragedies and other well publicized events, malicious actors will find ways to try to take advantage of people already in distress. Easy similarities can be made to COVID pandemic fraud , natural disaster scams or even tax season fraud (which may not be a traditional disaster, but certainly results in many distressed citizens). CrowdStrike recovery scams started immediately. In the days following the outage, CrowdStrike itself released information on identified spear phishing attempts . The company also released information on general malicious activity surrounding the event. Fraud examiners will recognize these commonly used attacks: malicious emails, scam phone calls and fake websites targeting companies reporting outages and their employees. Fraudsters posed as technical support or CrowdStrike staff offering refunds or remuneration for losses caused by the outage. The well publicized outage gave fraudsters an easy list of targets. As organizations added themselves to the growing list of businesses and government agencies that were temporarily unavailable, they were also painting themselves, and their customers, with targets. Emails were sent to known corporate addresses with malicious attachments. The emails posed as CrowdStrike, Microsoft or other technical support staff sharing important recovery information. An attached PDF promised to contain the method to restore crashed systems, or a download link promised to install a program that would protect as-yet unaffected systems. Websites were created within hours of the first major outage reports, using URLs similar to real CrowdStrike websites to steal information from unwary users or to host malicious software posing as solutions. Fake CrowdStrike social media sites cropped up, linking to malicious websites or asking for users to message the fraudsters posing as support through the social media platform. While not as directly connected, frauds and scams targeted at customers of businesses affected by the outage also see an increase. For example, airlines affected by the outage began issuing refunds to customers whose flights were cancelled. Fraudsters posing as the airline, aware of the outage, identify customers on social media posting about delays, cancellations or venting their frustration in the public forum. The fraudster then provides links to fake websites, fake social media accounts or phishes with targeted emails, phone calls or instant messages, convincing the customer their refund is just a few clicks away, they just need to provide their credit card information to process the refund. The Takeaway These kinds of events are inevitable, and fraudsters will always look to take advantage of them. Unfortunately, even with sound and consistent anti-fraud training for organizations and individuals, disasters and stress limit our attention to detail and make us more susceptible to hasty actions. Fraud examiners must stay ahead of the wave , reacting to situations appropriately with timely reminders to remain cautious and to look for solutions or assistance through secure channels. These scams are usually quick and dirty, so remind staff, friends and family of their traditional cyber security scrutiny: check the URLs, email addresses and usernames and avoid clicking links or downloading attachments. It is easy to do on a well-caffeinated, calm morning at the office, but significantly harder when you are stranded after a flight cancellation, your bank’s website is down, and you are hastily scrolling for solutions.",scam,"Easy similarities can be made to COVID pandemic fraud , natural disaster scams or even tax season fraud (which may not be a traditional disaster, but certainly results in many distressed citizens). CrowdStrike recovery scams started immediately. Fraud examiners will recognize these commonly used attacks: malicious emails, scam phone calls and fake websites targeting companies reporting outages and their employees."
Empowering Fraud Victims: Resources and Strategies for Recovery,Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=fraud-victim-resources-and-strategies-for-recovery,"Fraud investigation involves more than just uncovering financial discrepancies and bringing perpetrators to justice. It is essential to address the profound emotional and psychological impacts fraud can have on victims. Financial loss is often accompanied by feelings of betrayal, shame and trauma, which can linger long after the fraudulent activity has been discovered and reported. While support groups play a critical role, there are additional resources and strategies that can further aid in the recovery process for fraud victims. Understanding the Emotional Impact Fraud is not just about the money lost; it is about the trust broken and the sense of security shattered. Victims often experience a range of emotions, from anger and disbelief to guilt and embarrassment. As investigators, acknowledging these feelings and providing empathetic support can significantly affect the recovery process. Beyond Support Groups: Comprehensive Recovery Resources Counseling Services: Professional counseling can provide fraud victims with a safe space to process their emotions and develop coping strategies. Many victims benefit from speaking with therapists who specialize in financial trauma or fraud-related cases. Legal Aid: Access to legal advice and representation is crucial for fraud victims navigating the complexities of recovery. Organizations like Legal Aid offer free or low-cost services to help victims understand their rights and options. Financial Counseling: Rebuilding financial stability after a fraud incident can be daunting. Financial counselors can assist victims in creating a recovery plan, managing debt and rebuilding credit. Services like those offered by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) can be invaluable. Educational Workshops: Knowledge is empowering. Educational workshops can equip victims with the tools to protect themselves from future fraud. Topics may include recognizing red flags, understanding common fraud schemes and learning preventive measures. Building a Supportive Community Creating a supportive community is essential for fraud victims. Online forums, local meetups and social media groups can offer a sense of belonging and a platform to share experiences and advice. Online Forums and Communities: Websites like Reddit and dedicated forums for fraud victims provide an anonymous space for individuals to seek advice and share their stories. Local Meetups: Organizing local meetups can help victims connect with others in their area who have experienced similar fraud incidents. These gatherings can foster a sense of community and mutual support. Fraud victims need more than just financial restitution; they need comprehensive support that addresses their emotional, psychological and educational needs. As investigators and advocates, we must recognize the multifaceted nature of fraud recovery and provide victims with the resources and strategies necessary to rebuild their lives. By doing so, we empower them to move forward with confidence and resilience. You can find more resources for victims of fraud in Support Groups for Fraud Victims .",fraud investigation,Fraud investigation involves more than just uncovering financial discrepancies and bringing perpetrators to justice.
Warning Signs to Look Out for in Package Delivery Scams,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=warning-signs-package-delivery-scams,"When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, a majority of people turned to online shopping and delivering purchases directly to their home addresses. This rising trend in online shopping and home delivery has made package delivery scams increasingly prevalent, exploiting people's trust in legitimate shipping companies like FedEx, UPS or DHL. These scams often target individuals through text messages or emails, deceiving them into revealing personal information or making financial transactions under false pretenses. Understanding the warning signs associated with these scams is crucial to avoiding potential financial losses and identity theft. Package delivery scams typically involve fraudulent communications claiming to be from legitimate shipping companies. Scammers use various tactics to deceive recipients into believing they have a package waiting for delivery, a missed delivery attempt or an outstanding fee that needs to be paid. These messages often include links to fake websites that mimic the appearance of official shipping company websites. The primary goal of these scams is to trick individuals into providing personal information, such as credit card details or to install malicious software on their devices. Red Flags to Watch For Unsolicited Messages: Receiving unsolicited messages about package deliveries is a common red flag. Legitimate shipping companies typically only send notifications if you have opted in through their official channels. Suspicious URLs: Be cautious of URLs in text messages or emails. Scammers often use URLs that mimic legitimate shipping company websites but with slight variations. Hover over links to preview the destination URL and ensure they lead to the official site. Requests for Personal Information: Legitimate shipping companies do not ask for sensitive information such as social security numbers, credit card details or passwords via unsolicited messages. If a message requests that information, it is likely a scam. Urgency and Threats: Scam messages often create a sense of urgency or threat, stating that failure to respond or act immediately will result in consequences like package return or additional charges. These tactics are designed to pressure you into making hasty decisions. Unexpected Payment Requests: Be wary of messages requesting payment for delivery fees, customs charges or taxes unexpectedly. Legitimate shipping companies typically collect such fees at the time of delivery or through official notifications, not via unsolicited messages. Preventative Measures Verify Through Official Channels: Always verify the authenticity of messages by contacting the shipping company directly using contact information from their official website or customer service numbers. Check Sender Addresses: Double check the sender's email address or phone number for slight alterations that mimic official contacts (e.g., ""upsdelivery@gmail.com"" instead of ""@ups.com""). Report Suspicious Activity: Report suspected scam messages to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your country's consumer protection agency. This helps authorities quickly act against fraudulent schemes. Use Security Software: Ensure your devices have updated security software to protect against malware that may be included in scam messages. By being aware of the warning signs associated with package delivery scams, you can protect yourself from falling prey to these fraudulent schemes. Always verify the legitimacy of messages before taking any action and remember that legitimate shipping companies prioritize customer security and would never jeopardize it through unsolicited or suspicious communications. Taking these precautions can help you avoid potential financial losses and identity theft, ensuring a safer online shopping experience.",scam,"This rising trend in online shopping and home delivery has made package delivery scams increasingly prevalent, exploiting people's trust in legitimate shipping companies like FedEx, UPS or DHL.

Stolen Voices: The Dark Side of AI,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=stolen-voices-dark-side-artificial-intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming an increasing problem not just for hackers and fraudsters, but also for identity theft. Recently, there have been an influx of deepfakes of celebrities, but not just their faces—their voices. It is a big trend on social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, to post AI-generated singing using an artist's voice to predict what one of their unreleased songs might sound like. For example, AI was capable of replicating Taylor Swift and Post Malone’s voices to sing a fans prediction of what their collaborative unreleased song, “Fortnight,” would sound like. While it all seems playful and harmless, there is a dark side to this AI capability that is creeping up on actors' and singers' jobs. What is AI Voice Theft/Deepfake? AI voice theft, often referred to as deepfake audio, involves using artificial intelligence to replicate someone’s voice with astonishing accuracy. This technology employs sophisticated algorithms and neural networks to analyze and mimic the speech patterns, tone and cadence of a target individual. While deepfakes started with visual content, such as fake videos of celebrities or politicians, the advancement in audio deepfakes is now a pressing concern. This technology can be used for various purposes, ranging from creating entertaining content to committing fraud and identity theft. The misuse of AI-generated voices can lead to severe implications, including unauthorized financial transactions, manipulation and damage to personal and professional reputations. How is this affecting the movie and television industry? The movie and television industry are grappling with the impact of AI voice theft. Voice actors and dubbing artists are particularly vulnerable, as AI can now replicate their voices, potentially reducing the need for their services. This technology allows producers to generate dialogue for characters without requiring the actor to record it. Consequently, actors fear losing their jobs and the unique creative control they have over their performances. Moreover, the quality and emotional depth provided by human voice actors cannot be easily replicated by AI. Despite this, the cost-effectiveness and convenience of AI-generated voices present a significant temptation for producers, leading to ethical and economic dilemmas within the industry. Actors and AI: Several high-profile actors have become involuntary participants in AI voice theft scenarios: Scarlett Johansson Scarlett Johansson’s legal team is demanding transparency from OpenAI regarding the development of an AI voice assistant named “Sky,” which Johansson claims sounds eerily similar to her own voice . This issue surfaced after OpenAI’s live demonstration of the voice, leading many to draw comparisons to Johansson’s character in the 2013 film “Her.” Johansson revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously approached her about licensing her voice for the assistant, but she declined that offer. Johansson then went on to state that she was “shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference.” Keanu Reeves Keanu Reeves is actively fighting against AI-generated fraud through a notable partnership with HomeEquity Bank, featuring in a series of deepfake videos designed to raise public awareness about the dangers of deepfakes. This inventive campaign uses Reeves' recognizable face to highlight the importance of critically examining digital content and remaining vigilant against fraudsters leveraging advanced AI tools. Additionally, Reeves has taken personal measures to combat the misuse of AI , including a clause in his film contracts that prohibits the use of AI during any stage of production. Reflecting on the issue, Reeves remarked, ""When you give a performance in a film, you know you’re going to be edited, but you’re participating in that. If you go into deepfake land, it has none of your points of view. That’s scary."" Bad Bunny Bad Bunny has expressed his outrage over a viral TikTok song, ""NostalgIA,"" which uses AI to replicate his voice alongside fake vocals from Justin Bieber and Daddy Yankee. In a WhatsApp post to his 19 million followers, he vehemently condemned the track, stating that anyone who liked the song should leave his group chat and adding, ""You don't deserve to be my friends. I don't want them on the tour either."" Bad Bunny used strong language to describe his disdain for the AI-generated song. There is a growing concern among artists about the misuse of AI technology to clone their voices without consent, echoing similar sentiments expressed by Drake and The Weeknd when their voices were cloned for the viral track ""Heart On My Sleeve."" While some in the industry see potential in AI for music creation, the ethical and legal implications of voice cloning remain contentious. SAG-AFTRA Strike: Background actors and extras were asked to spend a day being cloned for producers to use an AI version of them in the background instead of hiring them and paying them for the days they would be there working. They were only offered compensation on the day of being cloned and would not be given any royalties for any production they were in. This practice raised so much concern over extras losing their jobs that it led to the SAG-AFTRA strike. How does this affect the anti-fraud industry? Even though it is still early in the AI evolution, it is crucial to be cautious about AI voice theft and deepfakes in the anti-fraud industry. While more recently, AI has been used to copy actors' and artists' voices, fraudsters could potentially utilize it to copy the voices of CEOs, high-level executives, or even people you know in order to scam you. This kind of AI-driven impersonation could lead to severe security breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information and financial fraud. Organizations and individuals must stay vigilant and adopt advanced verification methods to counteract the potential threats posed by AI-generated voice theft. While AI voice technology offers remarkable capabilities, its misuse presents significant ethical, economic and security challenges. Balancing innovation with protection against misuse is essential as society navigates the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence.",scam,"While more recently, AI has been used to copy actors' and artists' voices, fraudsters could potentially utilize it to copy the voices of CEOs, high-level executives, or even people you know in order to scam you."
Why a 25-Year Sentence? Sam Bankman-Fried's Conviction in Context,"Emily Homer,  PhD",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=sam-bankman-fried-sentencing-in-context,"On March 28, 2024, Samuel Bankman-Fried, the founder of the cryptocurrency trading firm Alameda Research and the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for his role in several fraud schemes. He was additionally sentenced to three years of supervised release following his prison term and required to forfeit USD 11 billion in illegal proceeds. In his roles, he defrauded customers, investors and lenders of more than USD 8 billion. This sentence was handed down after Bankman-Fried was convicted by a jury on a total of seven charges. These included two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering . He is currently appealing the conviction. The United States Sentencing Guidelines recommen ds more lenient sentences for cooperating with investigations, such as pleading guilty and self-disclosing wrongdoing. Accordingly , it is common for those who are convicted at trial to receive more severe sentences than those who plead guilty . Bankman-Fried’s sentence may have been enhanced based on his behavior during the trial and investigation. Several media sources , including Time , quoted judge Lewis Kaplan as stating that Bankman-Fried did not claim responsibility for his actions or express remorse. Kaplan also claimed that Bankman-Fried perjured himself three times during the trial , showed an “exceptional flexibility with the truth , ” and put on a “performance . ” Because the s entencing g uidelines are advisory, federal judges have discretion when sentencing offenders. This can result in wide discrepancies between offenders who have been convicted of similar or identical offenses , even within the same federal jurisdiction . Internationally, the punishment of financial crimes varies. The noted recent case of Truong My Lan in Vietnam demonstrates this. In her role as Chair of a large real estate development firm, Lan allegedly misappropriated assets and took out unlawful loans through the Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank. The Vietnam Investment Review reports that Lan directed in the creation of thousands of fabricated loans with a total value of VND 1 066 trillion ( USD 44.4 million ). Her convictions for multiple counts of embezzlement, giving bribes and ""violating regulations on banking operations and other activities related to banking activities"" resulted in Lan being sentenced to death under Vietnamese law. Lan appealed her conviction on April 26. S everal other offenders in Vietnam have also been sentenced to death for non-violent financial crimes. A n Amnesty International report discussing the death sentence of Duong Quant Tri notes 16 individuals who were sentenced to death or executed for financial crimes between January 2003 and May 2006 . More recently, in 2018, the Vietnamese appeals court upheld the death penalty conviction of Nguyen Xuan Son for engaging in a VND 1 trillion ( USD 44 million) banking scheme. CNN suggests that using the death penalty for financial criminals is in line with the country’s anti-corruption messaging. Chinese financial crime offenders have also been sentenced to the death penalty. Below are some recent U.S. cases of federal financial crime convictions, including the sentencing. Unless otherwise noted, the data sources for all the case descriptions are official U.S. Department of Justice press releases .

6 High-Profile Fraud Cases of the Past 6 Months,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=six-fraud-cases-first-six-months-2024,"Fraud cases seem to be a constant in our global financial landscape, often involving staggering amounts of money and complex, multifaceted schemes that capture the attention of the public and authorities alike. The first six months of 2024 have been no different, with several high-profile fraud cases coming to light. From massive corporate fraud in China to sophisticated cryptocurrency thefts and international scam networks, these cases underline the persistent challenges in combating financial crime. 1. Evergrande: China Accused Troubled Property Developer of Financial Fraud in $78 Billion Case CNN : March 19, 2024 Chinese regulators accused Evergrande, one of the country's largest property developers, of inflating revenues by $78 billion, marking the largest financial fraud case in mainland China's securities markets history. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) imposed a hefty penalty of CNY 4.175 billion (USD 580 million) on Hengda Real Estate, the group's main Chinese unit. Additionally, Evergrande's founder, Xu Jiayin, once China's richest man, was fined CNY 47 million (USD 6.5 million) and banned from the securities markets for life. The accusations stemmed from an eight-month investigation revealing that the company had fabricated 214 billion yuan (USD 30 billion) in sales for 2019 and another CNY 350 billion (USD 48.6 billion) in sales for 2020. These falsified figures significantly inflated Evergrande's net profits, ultimately leading to severe penalties and the company's forced liquidation ordered by a Hong Kong court in January 2024. 2. ‘Super Villain’ of $6 Billion Fraud Was Key to U.K. Laundering Trial, Lawyer Said Bloomberg : March 1, 2024 In the U.K., a woman named Jian Wen faced trial for allegedly laundering vast amounts of Bitcoin into cash. Her lawyer argued that Jian was manipulated by a “super villain,” Yadi Zhang (known as Zhimin Qian in China), who masterminded a USD 6 billion investment fraud in China. Jian, who unknowingly aided in the laundering operation, had her home raided by police who seized Bitcoin worth more than GBP 1.7 billion (USD 2.1 billion). The court heard how Zhang, a master of deception, created ten investment vehicles, scamming approximately 130,000 investors in China. Jian's lawyers contended that she was an unwitting participant, controlled by Zhang’s charisma and deceit. Zhang fled the U.K. in 2020, just before she was due for questioning, leaving Jian to face the consequences of the fraud. 3. Ippei Mizuhara Charged with Bank Fraud in Criminal Complaint MLB : April 11, 2024 Ippei Mizuhara, the former translator for MLB star Shohei Ohtani, was charged with bank fraud for illegally transferring more than USD 16 million from Ohtani's bank account to settle gambling debts. Mizuhara, who was dismissed by the Dodgers following the revelations, faced up to 30 years in federal prison if convicted. According to the United States Attorney for the Central District of California, Mizuhara carried out unauthorized wire transfers between November 2021 and January 2024, manipulating bank records and impersonating Ohtani to facilitate the fraud. Investigators found no evidence suggesting Ohtani's involvement in the fraudulent activities, confirming his status as a victim. 4. U.S. Brothers Arrested for Stealing $25 Million in Crypto in Just 12 Seconds BBC : May 15, 2024 Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, brothers and MIT graduates, were charged with wire fraud and money laundering after allegedly stealing USD 25 million in Ethereum cryptocurrency in a matter of seconds. The U.S. Department of Justice highlighted this as the first case of its kind, emphasizing the brothers' sophisticated understanding of Ethereum's transaction validation process. Their scheme involved intercepting and altering pending private transactions to siphon off the funds. When approached by Ethereum representatives, the brothers refused to return the stolen funds and instead attempted to launder them. If convicted, they each faced more than 20 years in prison. 5. Hundreds Rescued from Love Scam Centre in the Philippines BBC : March 14, 2024 A raid on a scam center in the Philippines led to the rescue of hundreds of people forced to engage in ""love scams."" These scams, also known as ""pig butchering"" scams, involved luring victims into fake romantic relationships to defraud them. The raid, which freed 383 Filipinos, 202 Chinese and 73 other foreign nationals, was initiated after a Vietnamese man escaped and reported his ordeal. Victims were tricked into posing as online lovers to steal money and personal information from unsuspecting targets. Authorities found evidence of torture and harsh conditions for those trapped in the scam center, underscoring the severe human cost of these operations. 6. Chinese Network Behind One of World’s ‘Largest Online Scams’ The Guardian : May 8, 2024 An international investigation revealed a vast network of fake online shops operated from China, duping over 800,000 people in Europe and the US. These fraudulent websites, posing as legitimate retailers of designer brands, collected money and sensitive personal data without delivering any products. The operation involved more than 76,000 fake websites and may have attempted to steal as much as EUR 50 million. The sophisticated network used expired domains to avoid detection, and personal data collected could potentially be exploited for future cybercrimes. This large-scale scam highlighted the growing threat of online fraud and the importance of robust cybersecurity measures. These six fraud cases from the past six months illustrate the varied and pervasive nature of financial crimes globally. Each case underscores the importance of vigilance, robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation to combat such sophisticated schemes effectively.","money laundering, scam","From massive corporate fraud in China to sophisticated cryptocurrency thefts and international scam networks, these cases underline the persistent challenges in combating financial crime.

The Value in Establishing Public-Private Partnerships,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=cap-lega-value-in-establishing-public-private-partnerships,"In a recent webinar presented to ACFE Corporate Alliance members and ACFE Law Enforcement and Government Alliance members, Lauren Kohr, Strategic Engagement Advisor of Public/Private Partnerships and Outreach for IRS-Criminal Investigations, and Victor Cardona, CFE, Senior Vice President and BSA Office Head of Anti-Money Laundering for Golden State Bank, delved into the significance of establishing public-private partnerships (PPP). Why Prioritize Public-Private Partnerships? These partnerships offer trusted points of contact, providing a reliable avenue for collaboration. Additionally, PPPs enable the leveraging of additional resources, enhancing the capacity to combat financial crimes effectively. By facilitating the ability to help “trace fraud,” enabling more timely responses and follow-up actions, PPPs play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of financial systems. Moreover, they foster network linkage and targeting, resulting in investigative efficiencies. Overall, prioritizing PPPs is instrumental in achieving collaborative efforts aimed at safeguarding financial institutions and the community against fraudulent activities. Partnerships allow for the sharing of targeted information, thereby resulting in a more efficient use of resources. This leads to allowing the private industry to conduct more focused and targeting fraud investigations, assisting to identify fraudulent activity that may not be detectable with automated systems or processes, and financial intelligence and information providing law enforcement with data to initiate or enhance investigations. Initiatives like Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Cornerstone Program and the El Camino Real Financial Crimes Task Force illustrate the power of collaboration in combating financial crimes. These partnerships bridge the gap between public and private sectors, fostering mutual understanding and cooperation. Framework Considerations for a PPP Before delving deeper into PPPs, it is essential to recognize that successful partnerships hinge on perspective, adaptability, trust and accountability, all vital components for maintaining the value chain. Understanding several framework considerations is crucial for establishing effective partnerships. Contribute : Partnerships thrive when both parties contribute resources, expertise, commitment and engage in training and knowledge sharing. Context : It is important to understand the context behind partnership establishment, encompassing risk and cost sharing along with joint decision-making. Perspective : Balancing perspectives from law enforcement and the private sector is critical, ensuring the protection of all stakeholders’ interests. Roles and Responsibilities : Roles and responsibilities must be clearly defined to set expectations, ensure accountability and maintain effective communication. Information Sharing : Information sharing acts as a gateway to meaningful and sustainable collaboration. Innovation : Innovation drives proactive fraud detection and prevention strategies. Establishing a Framework The goal is to serve as a continuous feedback loop of information obtained through PPPs, intelligence and information sharing to public and private sector partners and internal section of criminal investigations (CI). F.I.R.S.T.: F eedback I n R esponse to S trategic T hreats. Three-Pronged Approach CI FIRST PPP Initiative: This initiative focuses on the public-private partnership, emphasizing information sharing with private sector partners. CI FIRST Feedback Alerts: This creates a collaborative public-facing document to address emerging trends, typologies, red flags and training needs. CI FIRST Strategic Engagement and Information Sharing: This aspect evaluates the effectiveness of outreach efforts and identifies areas where each partner can bring value. Operationalizing Public-Private Partnerships Establishing a foundation for effective partnership and expanding the framework for strategic partnerships are pivotal steps in operationalizing PPPs. This requires a phased approach: Phase 1 : Foundation for an effective partnership. Phase 2 : Expanded framework for strategic partnerships – trusted, effective and tactical. Building Effective and Sustainable Partnerships – Where to Start Industry Trade Groups/Associations : Industry trade groups and associations, such as the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), provide valuable platforms for engagement, including chapter meetings, peer groups, conferences and centers of influence. Investing in the Partnership : This involves building trust, understanding perspectives and making time for meaningful interactions. Leverage and Expand the Partnership : Leveraging and expanding the partnership requires assessing opportunities, facilitating information sharing, network building and prioritizing capacity building of individuals, organizations, operations or products involved in the partnership. Succession/Transition Planning : This type of planning ensures continuity through smooth communication, identifying replacements and maintaining momentum. Overcoming Challenges in PPPs Challenges surround PPPs. Time constraints, limited resources, differing perspectives, mismatched priorities, and legislative environment, legal and privacy often hinder the PPP process. Overcoming these obstacles demands open communication, flexibility and a shared commitment to common goals. Time : 23% of the people who were polled at the beginning of this webinar said they do not have time. But how can we find time? Is there 15 minutes or half an hour, once a month, to start building that value chain for yourself? Effective time management is crucial for building value and fostering partnerships. Limited Resources : When challenged with limited resources, how do we best use the resources we do have? Optimizing available resources helps overcome limitations. Different Perspectives and Mismatched Priorities : Aligning different perspectives and priorities requires finding common ground for effective collaboration. Legislative Environment, Legal and Privacy : Navigating legislative and legal challenges necessitates engaging legal experts for guidance. Even with the challenges they may present, PPPs are indispensable in enhancing collaboration, leveraging resources and combating financial crimes effectively. By overcoming obstacles through open communication and shared commitment, PPPs can yield significant results in safeguarding financial systems.

The FTC's Battle Against Impersonation Fraud in the Digital Age,"Laura Harris,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=ftc-impersonation-rule,"The days of the funny prank phone calls are over. Yes, our refrigerators are running. No, we do not need to catch them. Lately, we are more concerned about robocalls impersonating President Biden, or other government officials, sowing bad advice and/or attempting to scam any earnest listeners. In February , the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated that it is “committed to using all of its tools to detect, deter and halt impersonation fraud” and opened up for commentary on a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPR). The proposed supplements would allow the FTC to more effectively and efficiently right consumers harmed by impersonation schemes and more effectively address the types of unlawful impersonation affecting consumers. Such changes would impact the finalized proposal to change the rules regarding government and business impersonation (entitled the Rule on Impersonation of Government and Businesses or Impersonation Rule). The SNPR proposal seeks to “add a prohibition on the impersonation of individuals and extend liability for violations of the Rule to parties who provide goods and services with knowledge or reason to know that those goods or services will be used in impersonations of the kind that are themselves unlawful under the Rule.” This comes at a time when the FTC reports fraud losses topping $10 billion in 2023, more than a 14% increase from 2022, and receiving more than 2.6 million fraud reports from consumers. The FTC’s Consumer Sentinel Network, which receives reports directly from consumers, all levels of law enforcement agencies, the Better Business Bureau, industry members and non-profit organizations received 5.4 million reports in 2023. (A full breakdown of reports received in 2023 is available on the FTC’s data analysis site .) The overwhelming number of complaints begs the attention of the FTC, which promotes a mission to protect the public from deceptive or unfair business practices and from unfair methods of competition through law enforcement, advocacy, research and education. The swiftly developing nature of artificial intelligence (AI) is a concern for consumers and businesses alike, as it is easily manipulated for fraudulent purposes. From deepfakes, voice-cloning, chatbots and mimicked writing styles, AI-supported scams are growing at an exponential rate. The finalized amendments to the Impersonation Rule state: It is a violation of this part, and an unfair or deceptive act or practice to: (a) materially and falsely pose as, directly or by implication, a government entity or officer thereof, in or affecting commerce as commerce is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44); or (b) materially misrepresent, directly or by implication, affiliation with, including endorsement or sponsorship by, a government entity or officer thereof, in or affecting commerce as commerce is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44). And It is a violation of this part, and an unfair or deceptive act or practice to: (a) materially and falsely pose as, directly or by implication, a business or officer thereof, in or affecting commerce as commerce is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44); or (b) materially misrepresent, directly or by implication, affiliation with, including endorsement or sponsorship by, a business or officer thereof, in or affecting commerce as commerce is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44). For example, the above enables the FTC to directly seek monetary relief in federal court from scammers that: Use government seals or business logos in communications with consumers by mail or online. Spoof government and business emails and web addresses, including mimicking “.gov” email addresses or using similar email addresses or websites that rely on misspellings of a company’s name. Falsely imply government or business affiliation by using terms that are known to be affiliated with a government agency or business (e.g., stating “I’m calling from the Clerk’s Office” to falsely imply affiliation with a court of law). However, several comments on the Impersonation Rule addressed the pervasive threat of individual impersonation, which led to the SNPR. The proposed amendment would prohibit not just impersonation of government entities and businesses, but also the impersonation of individuals. Additionally, it establishes third-party liability for companies and developers that know or have reason to know their technology is being used to defraud consumers through impersonation and misuse of their resources. By expanding the Impersonation Rule to include the impersonation of impersonation other than government entities and businesses, the FTC is able to pursue perpetrators of other impersonation schemes, such as romance frauds or grandparent schemes.",scam,"Lately, we are more concerned about robocalls impersonating President Biden, or other government officials, sowing bad advice and/or attempting to scam any earnest listeners.

Top 5 Fraud Trends of 2024,"Mason Wilder,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=top-5-fraud-trends-of-2024,"Detecting and preventing fraud is a daunting task that requires anti-fraud professionals to regularly adapt to a continuously evolving risk landscape. There are consistent factors in fraud, like social engineering tactics that exploit human behavioral tendencies or external financial pressures that lead fraudsters to commit their crimes, but there are also trends and themes that emerge and affect the anti-fraud profession on a more limited timeframe. Forecasting is inherently a risky exercise, but based on recent fraud-related news and discussions with subject matter experts over the course of regular ACFE operations, here are five trends that are expected to have a significant impact on the anti-fraud profession in 2024. Scams Enhanced by Generative AI Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, or deep learning AI models used for high-quality image, video, audio or text generation, became much more mainstream with the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022. The proliferation of easy-to-use generative AI software, such as programs or apps that generate deepfakes, has already been utilized by fraudsters to generate more convincing images, video, audio and text in their scams, but the scale of its weaponization will grow tremendously in 2024, and affect both individuals and organizations. One major fraud involving deepfakes of multiple people on a single video call already caused a multinational company in Hong Kong to lose more than $25 million this year, and numerous other examples of scams ranging from virtual kidnappings utilizing voice cloning technology to romance frauds leveraging text generation similar to ChatGPT capabilities have been reported and will only increase. As the technology gets better, so do the scams using it. Fraud examiners can help protect themselves, their employers or clients, and their communities by raising awareness about these scams, and encouraging everyone to exercise a high level of skepticism with any digital communications, but especially those that involve a request for money. A Resurgence of Cryptocurrency and Digital Asset Fraud Bitcoin was at its highest price since late 2021. Frauds and scams related to cryptocurrencies, coins, tokens and all the other confusing things under the digital assets umbrella have historically ebbed and flowed along with the prices of popular cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoins. With increased enthusiasm around digital assets and more mainstream adoption, fraudsters will follow. Expect an increase in SIM swaps, digital wallet account takeovers, ransomware, investment scams, hacks or exploitation of decentralized finance (DeFi) companies, and any other fraud schemes either targeting or involving digital assets.
The irreversibility and pseudonymity of digital asset transactions makes them inherently riskier, even when they are not extra attractive to fraudsters due to crypto prices, so consumers should stay diligent about not reusing their passwords for digital wallets, considering multifactor authentication protocols that do not rely on SMS, and being wary of any cannot-miss investment opportunities framing themselves as related to recently approved Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Sending fiat currency instead of cryptocurrency for a transaction will likely have more recourse available in the event of a fraud.
Meanwhile, fraud examiners at organizations that deal in digital assets or possess them should assess existing anti-fraud controls and look for opportunities to improve them. Fraud Involving AI Service Providers When a technology hype cycle kicks off, there is never a shortage of companies looking to cash in on the craze or investors looking to identify the next “unicorn” or spread investments across the sector to hedge their bets. This can create a lot of pressure for emerging technology-focused companies to perform, or at least maintain the appearance of performance to reassure existing investors and attract new ones, such as Theranos, Wirecard, Nikola and FTX. With more than $150 billion reportedly invested in AI startups since the beginning of 2021, the same kinds of financial pressures that led leaders of the previously mentioned companies to fabricate results or employ creative (fraudulent) accounting practices are in place for the AI sector. This might play out as a singular, major fraud scandal affecting a major player in the sector, with the direct impact mostly limited to the company’s investors and creditors. Alternatively, it could play out in the failure of multiple start-ups on a smaller scale. Either outcome would likely shake public faith in the sector and in turn affect the trajectory of the technology’s adoption and the viability of AI companies doing things by the book. Fraud examiners tasked with due diligence or auditing engagements concerning AI service providers should keep these factors in mind and perhaps apply a little more scrutiny to make sure that they do not overlook any red flags. Increased Obligations and/or Liabilities for Preventing and Detecting Fraud The passage, or royal assent, of the United Kingdom Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill in late 2023 establishes a new failure to prevent offence [sic] for organizations that profit from fraud committed by their employees, even if they were unaware of the fraud while it was occurring. Since new laws and/or regulations that emerge from Europe often end up producing copycat responses from other regions, anti-fraud programs could be tasked with preventing yet another fraud-related liability. Meanwhile, the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) recently proposed a change to its standards for auditors that would increase the responsibilities to detect fraud in a client’s financial statements. This came months after the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) made a similar proposal to update its standards related to auditors’ responsibilities to detect fraud. Although neither proposal has yet been adopted and reflected in updates to the standards, it could happen in 2024 and would have a significant impact on auditors and ultimately strengthen the anti-fraud profession, assuming auditors embrace the upgraded fraud detection responsibilities. Continued COVID Fraud Enforcement in the U.S. In 2022, the United States passed legislation that extended the statute of limitations for fraud related to several federal benefit programs from five years to 10, meaning that federal law enforcement in the U.S. will not have to be as selective with investigation, enforcement and prosecution of these fraud cases.
Many fraudsters who carried out COVID benefit fraud have yet to face any consequences from their schemes, simply because the resources required to work through the caseload have exceeded what the federal government has been able to allocate. As these fraudsters have been out there living their best lives, it is reasonable to suspect they have been looking for other fraud schemes to carry out, since most fraudsters do not decide to quit committing fraud when they believe they have gotten away with it. However, there are a great many federal law enforcement agents working dutifully to investigate these cases, so many fraudsters will be getting very unwelcome knocks on their doors in 2024 that could ultimately provide investigative leads for other frauds they have committed. These investigations and prosecutions will also likely provide incredibly valuable blueprints for future fraud investigations as law enforcement agents develop and hone new techniques to uncover and prove fraud, trace assets and recover funds. Time will tell how accurate or relevant these trends end up being this year, but hopefully these valuable insights can be extracted to aid in the prevention, detection or investigation of fraud in 2024 and beyond.","fraud investigation, scam","Scams Enhanced by Generative AI Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, or deep learning AI models used for high-quality image, video, audio or text generation, became much more mainstream with the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022.

Staying Positive and Resilient in Job Searching,"Colin May,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=staying-positive-and-resilient-in-job-searching,"Finding work in the fraud examination field can be very challenging, but this blog may help provide some perspective and ideas on how to stay motivated and resilient during a difficult job search. Be strategic in your approach to career development and use a proven methodology to help. Make everyday a learning experience Each day is an opportunity to practice and hone your skills as a fraud examiner, regardless of whether you are actually working on a fraud examination engagement. You can “interview” people and then write up the summary, conduct data analysis, spot-check documents and back-up information. All of these will help you to become a better fraud examiner. Here is a video on 25 ways that you can gain fraud examination experience: 25 Ways to get Fraud Investigation Experience - YouTube Network and build solid professional relationships The key to networking is to start small and build a long-lasting relationship with a small group of experienced professionals. This podcast from Coaching for Leaders describes how you can approach others for guidance and advice without seeming desperate or transactional. Get involved!

Explore ALL your options Being a fraud examiner takes many forms in different ways, across various industries. Being a forensic accountant usually requires a CPA license at a minimum, or if you’re working on federal taxes, you need to be an enrolled agent. But there are many ways to get into the game—take advantage of all the options and explore what is out there. In public service, for example, there are dozens of titles and roles which utilize the fraud examination methodology, but very few roles in the federal government use the title of “fraud examiner.” This video explains what types of jobs in government involved fraud investigation.

Stay positive about the future We live in an “on-demand” world and that translates to constantly wanting everything quickly. Unfortunately, job searches don’t work that way. Hiring managers are told to “hire slowly,” to ensure the right fit for the job. It is also partially a “numbers game,” where you are competing with hundreds—even thousands—of other applicants with varying qualifications. It is important to be known among your peers (and hiring managers) as a smart, qualified, well-rounded communicator and analyst. If you stay positive and use the growth mindset, you will recognize that it is about the journey, not a specific destination. This article also details some excellent advice on being purposeful and resilient in your job search. Be passionate about anti-fraud Albert Einstein once said that he didn’t have any special gifts or talents but was rather “passionately curious.” More recently, Oprah Winfrey said ""Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you."" Be passionate and curious about the work of fraud examination. Seek to learn as much as you can through a variety of ways. Apply your knowledge in everyday situations to practice; then reflect on what you have learned and what you can do differently. Be intentional about the organizations and positions that you apply to and make lasting connections to help people know who you are and why you are passionate about the work of fraud prevention, detection and investigation.

Fraud in Retail Settings: Gift Cards and Returns Schemes,"Emily Homer,  PhD",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=fraud-in-retail-settings-gift-cards-returns-schemes,"As I was waiting for a friend at a retail store during the recent holiday season, I overheard a front-end manager talking with a security officer. The manager described that another employee had noticed some suspicious behavior: customers of the store brought a small scale from home and were seen weighing gift cards using the scale. The pair discussed why the customers would have been weighing gift cards, with the manager suggesting that it may be to determine how much it would cost to mail the gift cards. As she departed, she said to the security officer, “Or it could be some sort of fraud.” I smiled at the mention of fraud, which the security officer noticed. We got into a brief discussion of how fraud can be committed in retail stores. The officer described a gift card scam her store had uncovered: scammers removed the silver strip over a gift card’s PIN, noted the card number and PIN, and replaced the silver strip. They were then able to track the gift card’s usage. Once the gift card was purchased, the scammers were able to steal the funds, victimizing both the store and the unsuspecting customer who bought the compromised gift card. The security officer’s description is a variation of gift card draining. While it may seem like a lower-level scam, gift card fraud has real consequences for retailers. An analysis of data drawn from the Federal Trade Commission’s Consumer Sentinel database found that gift card scams have led to a consumer loss of $148 million. Both the Federal Trade Commission and the 2023 National Retail Security Survey have reported increases in gift card scams in recent years. More specifically, 57% of the 177 retail brands responding to the National Retail Security Survey reported an increase in gift card scams from 2022 to 2023. A second scam common in retail settings is the return scheme. These schemes involve fraudulently victimizing a retailer during the process of completing a consumer return and refund. One study by Riskified identified many common return schemes on a scale of “friendly fraud” to serial abusers and professional fraudsters. These schemes included coupon abuse, false damage claims, item-not-received scams, authorized reseller abuse, empty box returns, photoshopped return labels and, most severely, fraudsters using the dark web to exploit returns policies. The National Retail Federation contributed additional return schemes, including the return of shoplifted/stolen merchandise and returns using counterfeit receipts. Consumers will also return items after using or wearing them, intending to informally ‘rent’ the items as opposed to purchasing them (a practice sometimes referred to as wardrobing). In their “2023 Consumer Returns in the Retail Industry” report, the National Retail Federation reported that its survey respondents reported $101 billion loss to returns abuse and fraud. Regardless of its form, retail fraud is a concern for many retailers and a reality of doing business. In the study by Riskified of more than 300 merchants, nine out of ten reported experiencing significant costs from multiple fraud and abuse schemes. However, there are ways that merchants can attempt to combat losses to scams including gift card and return schemes. Some suggestions include: Review returns and refund policies for loopholes. Consider eliminating cash refunds for purchases not made in cash, implementing a time frame for allowable returns, offering store credit instead of a cash refund and requiring receipts when making a return. Make quantitative data available regarding customers’ purchase and returns history. Review the data for abnormalities. Require returns to be made in-person so an employee can physically verify the item’s condition and determine the authenticity of the sale and receipt. Keep gift cards close to the registers or behind them to increase the risk of detection for scammers attempting to tamper with gift cards. For online retailers, give detailed and accurate item descriptions so the customer has a greater likelihood of getting what they want without the need to return. Offer ways for customers to virtually see the items on themselves or in their homes before purchasing. Consider automating processes to identify transactions that require further investigation. Riskified suggests that, where possible, companies use automated processes to identify customers who return large numbers of purchases and review item-not-received claims to identify those that might not be authentic. These processes can help detect fraud and determine if specific individuals’ purchasing ability should be restricted. Rates of retail scams often rise at specific times and under specific conditions. The study from Riskified found that 70% of merchants reported an increase in abuse during the summer shopping season and 67% reported an increase during the post-holiday season. Rates of retail fraud and abuse also increase with rising inflation. However, combatting these forms of retail fraud should be a concern for companies regardless of the time of year or circumstance.",scam,"The officer described a gift card scam her store had uncovered: scammers removed the silver strip over a gift card’s PIN, noted the card number and PIN, and replaced the silver strip.

The Dichotomy of Modern Government Fraud Schemes and Government Oversight’s Contrasting Approach,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=modern-government-fraud-schemes-and-government-oversights-contrasting-approach,"By: Erik Halvorson While reading a recent Bloomberg article about deepfake imposter scams and new fraud trends, I was struck immediately by their graphic . There appeared to be an overwhelmingly substantial number of “high loss” fraud schemes being perpetrated in 2022 (as reported by the Federal Trade Commission). This was shocking as it appeared to show more high loss cases than low loss cases. This would signal a marked departure from decades of historical statistics. Statistics we, in program oversight, rely upon to strategize our anti-fraud endeavors. Upon first glance, I felt a sense of righteous vindication as I have been shouting about the increased risk of sophisticated, high dollar loss schemes for years. Risk to the types of government programs that we see far too often splashed across the headlines of the news. The type of programs funded by massive budgets, guided by program managers who just review self-certifications; programs with funds spread out across multiple federal or state agencies, and overseen by contract or grant administrators trying to review hundreds of awards at a time. In fact, my fear over the last few years has changed. It is no longer the company that gets awarded a few grants or contracts and underperforms on them or fibs on an hourly timecard. My fear, and what keeps me up at night, has turned to stare down a massive tidal wave of domestic organized crime groups, international state sponsored groups, coordinated Fraud-as-a-Service (FaaS) groups, and creative hackers across the globe with technical prowess and seemingly unlimited energy. All these groups share one common goal: the constant targeting of slow-moving and poorly defended government programs. These same government programs run by bureaucrats who fear if they slow the release of funds, even a little, to put controls in place they will be lambasted by their department or in the media. Then I looked deeper into the chart and was offended as both a researcher and investigator. I realized first this is a terribly misleading graphic and second that even though I dislike the graphic the underlying premise of the article holds true. So, let us talk (briefly) about the graphic first, then explore the underlying message. You will notice a small footnote on the graphic that there were approximately 360,000 fraud reports of $1,000 or less. Combining the foot note with the strange Y-Axis groupings we see objectively there are significantly more small cases than large. Thus, bringing order back to our expectations of fraud case loss sizes and the volume of fraud we experience in government oversight. Setting the graphic off to the side, let us talk about the underlying premise of the article. There is absolutely a new wave of fraud that is being perpetuated by new technology. Deepfakes are a part of those new fraud schemes, as the articles describe. Another fraud area on the rise is the use of generative AI Large Language Models (LLMs) and the use of “AI technology” to boost schemes by bad actors. AI Large Language Models are programs like ChatGPT. Technology boosts are technological enhancers like AI generated photos, voice simulators, phone number spoofers or AI coding systems that will write a malicious code for you. Both AI technology and technology boosts serve to bridge the gap for less technologically savvy bad actors who want to increase the complexity and sophistication of their fraud across their area of attack. One of the more interesting cases to emerge recently is dubbed FraudGPT . This program reportedly automates different phishing schemes and helps coach would-be fraudsters with suggestions on where to place malicious links. It also contains information on what the most frequently exploited online resources are and can even generate harmful code for its customers. The rise of a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) program without ethical constraints, used to support fraud, is fairly predictable. But, this GPT program has a surprising difference, the way this GPT service (purchasable through the dark web or via telegram’s messaging secure instant messaging groups) is marketed. FraudGPT has a monthly subscription fee. That is right, not even criminals can get away from the modern era of micro-billing services. Reportedly, the cost to use FraudGPT is $200 per month or $1,700 per year; which admittedly does provide a healthy 29% discount for annual membership. Despite being impressed by the discount, a subscription fee-based model is a business practice I did not think I would ever see in fraud. A practice that seems to demonstrate the organization and quasi-legitimacy of modern fraudsters. Because in the past can any of us see anyone linking their payment information to a service designed to break the law? That seems like one good cyber-based law enforcement operation away from unmasking a ton of bad actors. Thinking about this situation objectively brings me back to sitting on a panel at Denver’s annual fraud retreat . During a panel I was asked how we should think about AI as it revolutionizes the world around us, and specifically in the area of fraud and anti-fraud mitigation. In my opinion, as oversight professionals, we need to expect to see two things. The first is that with AI boosting technological proficiencies we will see more fraud generally, both in increased sophistication and by volume of cases. The truth is technology has made fraud easier. We need to do everything we can to prepare for this. The next is that while the area of technological fraud grows (and government slowly incorporates technological countermeasures and proactive analytics units) we will also see a rise in unsophisticated traditional fraud schemes. If you follow any of the financial crimes groups you will see that check fraud, for instance, almost doubled between 2021 and 2022 (up to ~680,000 instances in 2022) and will cost consumers a staggering $24B in 2023 . Technology has created a very strange dichotomy in our everyday world and fraud is a microcosm of that world. On the one hand, we have some of the most sophisticated technological fraud schemes ever now being attempted more often and by a broader swath of bad actors. On the other hand, as our focus, manpower and resources, move to combat technology enhanced schemes we leave a blind spot for unsophisticated schemes to thrive in. This idea about voluminous unsophisticated schemes thriving is supported by the footnote found on the initial chart we looked at. At a ratio of 2.2:1, schemes of $1,000 or less are outpacing all other fraud scheme loss amounts. If we look at scams which stole $10,000 or less on our initial chart, we see more than 523,000 cases (a ratio of more than 6:1 in favor of smaller schemes). While at the same time, year over year, we see a baffling continuous growth in larger, more sophisticated fraud schemes as well. Forcing us (in many cases) to either ignore one of the two types of fraud schemes or at best split our focus, funding and manpower. And in large government programs mired by years of “more with less” and “get the money out ASAP; we will chase the fraud later” this is a recipe for disaster. Ultimately as fraud fighters trying to combat a rising tide of fraud of all levels of complexity, we need to be more flexible and dynamic. To do this we should leverage new technology and fraud analytics techniques by implementing tools being developed by private and commercial software companies. We should understand that social science research has progressed in areas of psychology, criminology, sociology and machine learning/AI that support our effort to identify fraud schemes earlier. This will give our controls a competitive advantage in identifying fraud and keeping losses low. We also need to invest time and money into growing our people skills. As a special agent of 13 years, I have witnessed a steep decline in our ability to manage human assets, especially post-pandemic. We need to hone interview skills. We need to understand how to build (and maintain) long term strategic relationships with individuals outside our oversight field. And, even with the growth in technology we should remember our best assets are still our people. Especially supporting those that still possess their creative problem solving and optimism in the face of an increasingly difficult bureaucratic system to work and thrive in. Fusing the human element with technological and research-based advancements might just give us the boost we need to combat these schemes. And while I cannot say for sure it will work, I can say for sure that if we fail to innovate and implement agile oversight we will fail. And failing means we continue to see headlines about losing billions of dollars in federal funds to fraud — headlines that will continue to erode public trust in our ability and the necessity of our work.",scam,"By: Erik Halvorson While reading a recent Bloomberg article about deepfake imposter scams and new fraud trends, I was struck immediately by their graphic .

"Fraud, Waste and Abuse Schemes in the Addiction Treatment Industry",Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=fraud-waste-and-abuse-addiction-treatment-industry,"By: Isaac Asamoah Substance use disorder ( SUD ), commonly referred to as just addiction, is a treatable mental disorder that affects a person’s brain and behavior, leading to their inability to control their use of substances like legal or illegal drugs, alcohol or medications. With addiction being the most severe form of SUD, symptoms can range from moderate to severe. In 2021, drug abuse was added to the list of high-risk situations by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). GAO high-risk list are areas susceptible to increased fraud, waste and abuse. Treatment for substance use disorders was an out-of-pocket expense that only the wealthy could afford until the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act was passed in 2008. More people now have access to SUD treatment because of the passage of legislation like the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that the financial cost of substance addiction is $193 billion for illegal drug usage and $249 billion for alcohol consumption. Causes of the Opioid Crisis in the United States The Congressional Budget Office pinpoints 3 factors that led to the Opioid epidemic in 2018. These factors are increase in prescription by physicians, increase in demand for self-medication, increase in consumption of opioid medications due to the illicit access of the market and illegal trafficking of opioids into the market. Fraud and Abuse in Substance Abuse and Addiction Treatment Fraud occurs in a variety of healthcare settings, such as laboratories, dentist offices, home health agencies, pharmacies and transportation. What, therefore, distinguishes fraud, waste and abuse in drug use disorders? According to (SAMSHA 2014), the SUD treatment sector is expected to continue growing, reaching a value of $34 billion by 2020. Only 2.7 million (6.5%) of the 41.1 million persons who need treatment for substance use disorders (SUD) during the course of the previous year received it at a specialty treatment center, according to the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (National Survey on drug abuse and health, 2020). Help is needed for vulnerable individuals to treat their substance dependence, yet many of them receive little to no assistance because of fraud, waste and abuse schemes. Zachary A. Cunha, the defendants' attorney, stated, ""What makes the fraud scheme that we have charged today particularly pernicious is that it was not only, as we allege, designed to defraud by enriching these defendants with federal and private healthcare dollars they did not earn,"" but it also defrauded a vulnerable population of recovery patients of the full, genuine support and treatment that they need to have. As per an investigation by STAT and the Boston Globe , individuals struggling with drug addiction are being used as pawns in a large-scale nationwide insurance fraud operation. Taking advantage of the growth in opioid addiction, these profit-seekers have accepted patients from all around the country. For Peter San Angelo, who had been using heroin for ten years and was homeless, the promise of free insurance and lavish rehab in a faraway state turned out to be a lifeline. Using a fictitious address, a patient broker registered the Massachusetts man in a Pennsylvania Blue Cross plan and bought him an airline ticket to Florida. They even made a money-saving offer to purchase him cigarettes. Three months after the 33-year-old drug overdosed, he passed away. Agencies Collaborating to Tackle Substance Use Disorder Treatment Fraud The Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) is the primary agent charged with tackling healthcare fraud in the United States. However the FBI works with federal and state agencies such as the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Inspector General (HHS – OIG), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA), Food and Drugs Authority (FDA), Center for Disease Control (CDC), Health Resources Services and Administration (HRSA), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), US Department of Justice – Office of Inspector General (USDOJ – OIG), Heroin and Opioid Awareness, Department of Homeland security (DHS) and the office of National and Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) etc. Apart from these federal agencies, the FBI works with state and private public agencies such as the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU), Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership (HFPP), National Healthcare Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA) and the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). Example of Fraud Scheme in Sober Homes The announcement of the sober living homes cases on its one-year anniversary in 2020 marked the celebration of the first-ever national sober homes initiative , which included charges against more than a dozen criminal defendants in connection with over $845 million in allegedly false and fraudulent claims for tests and treatments for vulnerable patients seeking treatment for drug and/or alcohol addiction. The over $133 million in false and fraudulent claims that are additionally alleged in cases announced today reflect the ongoing efforts of the National Rapid Response Strike Force and the Health Care Fraud Unit Strike Force to prosecute individuals involved in illegal kickback and bribery schemes involving the referral of patients to substance abuse treatment facilities—where those patients may be subjected to medically unnecessary drug testing. Example of Fraud Schemes in Addiction Treatment One of the earliest healthcare fraud tactics is upcoding. In the addiction treatment sector, upcoding refers to doctors charging for higher level visits than actually completed (typically in an effort to receive higher reimbursements). For example, a doctor has up coded the service if they charge an addiction patient the maximum evaluation and management CPT 99215 (40+ minutes) for a visit that only took 25 minutes. CPT 99214 is the right code that the doctor ought to have used. A news release about an addiction treatment center accused of healthcare fraud was issued by the USDOJ in 2023. According to the documents included in the press release, Brier, Bruining and RCCA operated a chain of addiction treatment centers but failed to provide patients with the required therapy and counselling sessions. In addition, they commonly submitted claims for 45-minute counselling sessions to Medicare, Medicaid and other health care payers, even though the sessions typically lasted 10 minutes or less. There have been times when the available therapist could not have finished the total quantity of treatment sessions in a 24-hour period due to the volume of sessions being billed at this rate. P atient brokerage FWA schemes in the addiction industry includes patients shopping for prescriptions from physician to physician. Patients occasionally receive more prescriptions for medications than they need. This results in patients selling or giving their medications to family and friends. These medications are usually paid for through federal and state insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Obtaining patients from patient recruiters is another aspect of patient brokerage for doctors. In exchange for patients, this typically entails the doctor paying the recruiter gifts and incentives, or ""kickbacks."" A South Florida clinic convicted in a $112 million addiction treatment fraud scheme was highlighted by the USDOJ in 2022. According to the Boston Globe and STAT investigation , patient brokers are paid for putting insured people in touch with treatment facilities; the treatment facilities then pocket thousands of dollars' worth of claims for each patient. Because Blue Cross Blue Shield plans have generous benefits and few restrictions on using out-of-network treatment programs for medical care, they often target specific plans. In the addiction treatment sector, invoicing for services not provided and performing unnecessary procedures for addicted individuals is another FWA scheme. To assist addicts in regaining sobriety, sober living homes are registering residents, but in the absence of stringent policies such as federal and state oversight agencies keeping an eye on and requiring proof of recovery from sober living homes, these patients might remain in the sober living homes as long as they can continue to bill federal and state insurance programs for profits at the expense of providing patients with high-quality care. The public was alerted to fraud schemes targeting Native Americans in May 2023 by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General. HHS-OIG advisory: Scammers set up fictitious sober living homes that claim to provide addiction treatment and assistance, specifically targeting vulnerable Native Americans. However, people who are asking for help are seriously put at risk because these places are fronts for illegal activity. In addition, Native Americans are the target of schemes including healthcare fraud and human trafficking. By adopting the identity of medical experts, thieves use victims' personal information and medical identities to sell fraudulent medical services or treatments. Subsequently, they make fraudulent charges for services that were never provided. A STAT / Boston Globe investigation revealed that patients are being moved to treatment centers hundreds of miles away from their homes for expensive, but frequently poor, care that is covered by premium health insurance benefits obtained using false addresses. In exchange for providing those patients, labs routinely pay fictitious bribes to sober houses. In order to continue receiving kickbacks fraudsters schedule a lot of tests or make drug-addled residents produce samples for patients who do not exist. Three people were found guilty on Monday, according to federal prosecutors, of conspiracy to submit fraudulent claims for drug and alcohol treatment for students in order to cheat California's Medi-Cal program out of over $20 million. According to the statement, the group that was found guilty allowed students to enroll in its program for four years, until 2013, even if they had only once used alcohol or drugs. The students then produced paperwork to support their claim that they were suffering from a ""medically diagnosed substance use disorder."" Furthermore, the organization submitted bills for payment to the state's Medi-Cal drug program after forging student signatures on documents that purported to show that they had attended counselling sessions. Post-mortem billing is the practice of doctors invoicing insurance companies—federal, state and private—for services provided to patients who have passed away. One technique to identify post-mortem I is to compare the date of service provided by the doctors with the member's death data that they have billed for. It is considered healthcare fraud if the billing was completed after the patient passed away. Medical practitioners frequently treat a variety of medical issues in their patients with controlled medications on a regular basis. From time to time, a provider may be subject to scrutiny by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which is looking into charges of drug diversion. A number of DEA enforcement actions , including the suspension or cancellation of their registration for the controlled substance, the loss of their state medical license or even criminal prosecution, may follow allegations that doctors or pharmacies are unlawfully dispensing controlled substances.","bribery, scam","The over $133 million in false and fraudulent claims that are additionally alleged in cases announced today reflect the ongoing efforts of the National Rapid Response Strike Force and the Health Care Fraud Unit Strike Force to prosecute individuals involved in illegal kickback and bribery schemes involving the referral of patients to substance abuse treatment facilities—where those patients may be subjected to medically unnecessary drug testing.

HOA Fraud is a Hardly Detected and Thriving Cancer of Our Society,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=hoa-fraud-hardly-detected,"By: Olga Zlatkova-Georgiev For most people, one of the main goals in life is buying your own home. It is rewarding when effort goes into career growth, diligent savings routines and work-life balance sacrifice, for this single goal of purchasing your first home.  The most affordable homes can be the ones built as part of a homeowner’s association (HOA) – nothing wrong with that. The surroundings are always maintained through the HOA and the only thing homeowners need to worry about is the interior of the house, as well as paying regular monthly dues to the HOA.  But after settling in, it may quickly become apparent that living under an HOA involves a level of oversight that can be surprising. Some examples of this are: After moving in the warm weather came and an umbrella needed to be installed on the patio. Immediately after my umbrella installation, a letter was received stating that it is a “violation” letter due to the color of the umbrella being blue. I purchased a potted flower and placed it under my kitchen window. The next day, a note was placed on my porch. It was a letter from the cleaning lady, who is also a renter from this complex. The letter is two pages long, handwritten and explains in detail how to take care of the flower. A few months later, the same lady knocked on my door to give me a brand-new harness for my dog, along with a business card from a dog trainer because she had seen how much my dog was pulling on the leash during walks. Another few months go by, when my investigating intuition kicked in, it was discovered that this same person is the HOA’s “spy,” with access to cameras and was being paid by the management company to clean the laundry rooms and the mailrooms for the complex. In addition, during board meetings, it was discovered that the board consists of people who do not know what their position is and are being appointed through acclamation, term after term. Soon after it came to light that the management company had been managing the place for 16 years, with no questions about the financial transactions ever, as well how contractors are being chosen, how much money is being spent out of the reserves account of the HOA and for what purpose. Hey, how about asking for the financial statements – something that is normal to ask for? When I asked for the financial statements of the HOA, the manager’s response was: “The board has advised that your request needs to be reviewed by the HOA’s attorney.” What? It is the most common knowledge related to the HOA laws and rules, that it is the homeowners’ right to review financial statements. Does this sound like a red flag? So, what is inside the financial statements? Gift card purchases for large dollar amounts with no explanation, returned fines to the owner who appears to be friends with the board member, board member’s home renovation that included upgrades. The most interesting was the comparative analysis of the year-to-year balances of the reserves account: emptied throughout the fiscal year and then re-funded again with the new budget and increase of monthly dues every fiscal year. One gentleman who had lived in this same HOA for 30 years, remembered seeing the management company’s owner the first day they took over this property, shredding the HOA’s documents. The homeowners gathered to put our minds together about how to make changes. The main step was changing the board and the management company. I started doing my homework and researching this particular company and the laws on how to change the board. My research began with searching for “HOA problems” on the web and about HOA problems known to other ACFE members and fraud investigation professionals. The discovery was mind-blowing. When connecting with people who had been experiencing mismanagement by the same property management company, we found a few commonalities with them. These other associations’ reserve accounts were in the red and with an elevated risk for special assessment. For example, it appeared that a lot of people, including members of the ACFE – were affected by fraud within their HOAs at some point in their lives. I started talking to HOA attorneys and one of them said to me after hearing my story that “your community is lucky to have you.” Together with other like-minded neighbors we called for a special meeting by the members, as per the rules. Immediately, we received sabotage from the operating board and the management company. Their HOA lawyer served their private interest and not the interest of the community. Long story short, they did not recognize the special meeting as being legal and respectively never showed up. Nonetheless, our community was able to collect more than 50% of members’ votes for board removal. We collectively hired a lawyer who recommended collecting signatures for a petition, in addition to the votes, to make the case stronger. One day, when collecting signatures, I was sending messages to my neighbors explaining to them what the lawyer’s recommendation was. In my messages, I used the expression “this would be a cherry on top.”  A few hours later, one of the board members blasted a mass text message to 164 people, by using a VoIP phone, saying, “Do not sign anything and Olga’s cherry is rotten.” As you can see, harassment during investigating HOA fraud is quite common. When speaking to a lady from the ACFE Community, for example, I learned how a drone had been sent to spy on her right at her window. I have heard a lot of insane stories along the way of my HOA fraud journey. The main conclusion that was made from all of it was: HOA fraud is not controllable most of the time, due to weak jurisdiction. It is a hardly detected and thriving cancer of our society. ACFE members have exclusive access to the HOA Fraud group in the members-only online community.",fraud investigation,My research began with searching for “HOA problems” on the web and about HOA problems known to other ACFE members and fraud investigation professionals.
Emerging Trends in Fraud Law: What Professionals Need to Know,Stephanie Gordon,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=emerging-trends-in-fraud-law,"In the ever-evolving landscape of fraud, staying informed about emerging trends is not just a choice — it is a necessity. As professionals in the field of fraud prevention, we understand that knowledge is our most potent weapon against the ever-adaptive tactics of fraudsters. In this blog, we will delve into these trends and explore how to prevent fraud schemes, scams and social engineering exploits. We will also shed light on how machine learning and real-time verification can be leveraged to protect against phishing and the automation of financial crimes. Let us explore this topic to equip ourselves with the knowledge to combat emerging fraud. Current Trends in Fraud Law: A Brief Overview Fraud is a serious and costly problem that affects individuals, businesses and financial institutions. Fraud involves the intentional use of deception or misrepresentation to obtain an unfair or unlawful advantage. In the digital age, fraudsters have more ways to exploit vulnerabilities and defraud unsuspecting victims. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), the median loss caused by fraud is a staggering $3.6 million. Account takeover fraud, the fastest-growing type of fraud, witnessed a 74% increase in losses in 2021. Synthetic identity fraud, a growing concern, accounted for $24 billion in losses in 2020. It not only highlights the importance of robust internal controls and expert fraud lawyers but also emphasizes the need for financial institutions to implement AI and machine learning, along with multiple detection methods. Fraud Trends to Watch Out for in 2024 The world of fraud is constantly evolving, with new scams and schemes emerging all the time. This means that fraud law professionals need to stay up-to-date on the latest trends in order to effectively represent their clients. Here are some of the emerging trends in fraud law that professionals need to know about: Synthetic identity theft: Synthetic identity theft is a type of fraud in which criminals create new identities by piecing together elements of a person's personal information, such as name, date of birth and Social Security number, and combining them with false identifiers. Synthetic identities can then be used to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards and commit other types of fraud. Deepfakes: Deepfakes are videos or audio recordings that have been manipulated to make it appear as if someone is saying or doing something they never actually said or did. Deepfakes can be used to commit fraud in a variety of ways, such as impersonating a celebrity to endorse a product or service or creating fake videos of someone committing a crime. Account takeover fraud: Account takeover fraud occurs when a criminal gains access to a victim's online account, such as a social media account, email account or bank account. Once the criminal has access to the account, they can use it to steal money, commit identity theft or spread malware. Cryptocurrency scams: Cryptocurrency scams are on the rise as more and more people invest in cryptocurrencies. These scams can take many different forms, such as fake cryptocurrency exchanges, investment scams and phishing emails. Insider threats: Insider threats are fraud schemes that are committed by employees or other individuals who have access to privileged information. Insider threats can be very difficult to detect and prevent, and they can cause significant damage to businesses and organizations. Fraud law professionals who are aware of these emerging trends will be better equipped to represent their clients and protect them from fraud. The Growing Need for Multi-Layered Fraud Prevention In the relentless battle against fraud, traditional prevention methods often fall short in addressing the ever-evolving tactics of fraudsters. The surge in fraud cases, including the prevalent takeover through sim swap fraud, underlines the urgency to innovate. A single layer of defense is no longer sufficient. To tackle the escalating fraud risk, it iss imperative to adopt a multi-layered approach. By integrating various fraud prevention and detection techniques, financial institutions can effectively reduce risk and protect themselves and their customers from potential financial losses. This approach equips professionals to stay ahead in the fight against fraud, employing a robust security framework that leaves no room for fraudsters to exploit vulnerabilities. Stay informed, adapt and use more than one strategy to fortify your defenses and mitigate the impact of fraud. How AI and Real-Time Analytics Can Enhance Fraud Detection One of the pivotal tools in the battle against fraud is artificial intelligence (AI), which is adept at automating the scrutiny of extensive data and identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent activity. This innovative technology significantly contributes to risk assessment, helping financial institutions stay ahead of evolving fraud. Furthermore, AI is instrumental in reducing fraud losses by expediting and refining fraud response and mitigation. When integrated with real-time analytics, it allows financial institutions to monitor transactions and customer behavior promptly, promptly flagging potential fraud incidents before they impact critical financial operations. Here are some specific things that fraud law professionals can do to stay up-to-date on the latest trends: Read industry publications and blogs: There are a number of industry publications and blogs that focus on fraud and fraud prevention. Reading these publications can help fraud law professionals stay informed about the latest trends and developments in the field. Attend industry conferences: There are also a number of industry conferences that focus on fraud and fraud prevention. These conferences can be a great way for fraud law professionals to learn about the latest trends and developments in the field and to network with other professionals in the field. Take continuing education courses: There are a number of continuing education courses that are available on fraud and fraud prevention. Taking these courses can help fraud law professionals stay up-to-date on the latest trends and developments in the field. By taking these steps, fraud law professionals can stay one step ahead of the criminals and protect their clients from fraud. Staying Ahead: Your Arsenal Against Fraud In the relentless fight against fraud, staying informed about emerging trends is not just an option—it is a necessity. The landscape of financial crime trends is ever-shifting, demanding our vigilance and adaptability. Detecting and preventing fraud requires a proactive approach, integrating risk assessment, detection methods and robust security measures.

AI's Double-Edged Sword: How Fraudsters are Weaponizing Intelligence,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=how-fraudsters-are-weaponizing-artificial-intelligence,"In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool with the potential to revolutionize industries and streamline processes. However, like any tool, AI can be wielded for malicious purposes. Fraudsters are increasingly leveraging AI to enhance the efficiency and sophistication of their scams. The Rise of AI in Fraud Fraudsters have embraced AI as a game-changer in their illicit activities. One prominent example is the use of AI-generated content, such as text, to manipulate and deceive individuals. ChatGPT, a large language model capable of generating human-like text, has been employed to create convincing messages, emails and even entire websites that mimic legitimate sources. Social Engineering at Scale AI-powered chatbots can engage in sophisticated social engineering attacks, manipulating individuals into divulging sensitive information. These bots, powered by advanced language models, can understand context, personalize messages and respond dynamically, making them highly effective in convincing unsuspecting targets to share personal or financial information. Imagine receiving a message from what appears to be a legitimate company's customer support, seamlessly engaging in conversation and subtly extracting sensitive details. The AI-driven nature of these interactions makes it challenging for individuals to discern between genuine and fraudulent communications. Automated Phishing Campaigns Phishing attacks, where fraudulent entities attempt to trick individuals into revealing confidential information, have also benefited from AI advancements. AI can optimize phishing campaigns by generating realistic emails that mimic official communications from banks, government agencies, organizations, companies or popular online platforms. These messages often contain malicious links or attachments, leading recipients to fake websites designed to steal login credentials or install malware. As a simple example, I asked this of ChatGPT: “Please write a short email for my small business website with these guidelines: State that their account has been accessed by someone else. State that if that is not them, they need to change their password. Include a link for them to change their password.” And this was the response ChatGPT gave me: While the phishing email layout above is simplistic, fraudsters leverage AI to craft sophisticated and convincing emails, texts, deepfake calls or videos, websites and various other mediums. This enables them to effectively deceive and exploit vulnerable individuals, extracting sensitive information for malicious purposes. Staying Vigilant Against AI-Powered Fraud As AI continues to play a role in fraudulent activities, it is crucial for individuals and organizations to stay vigilant. Here are some tips to protect yourself against AI-powered fraud: Verify the Source: Always verify the source of unexpected communications. If you receive a message, email or call requesting sensitive information, independently confirm the identity of the sender before sharing any details. Check for Anomalies: Scrutinize messages for anomalies, such as unusual language, tone or requests. AI-generated content may lack the nuance and personal touch of genuine communication. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enable MFA whenever possible to add an extra layer of security. Even if login credentials are compromised, MFA can prevent unauthorized access. Educate Employees: Organizations should provide regular training to employees on recognizing and reporting potential AI-powered fraud. Awareness is a powerful defense against evolving threats. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest developments in AI and cybersecurity. Understanding potential risks and emerging trends can empower individuals to make informed decisions and recognize potential threats. While AI brings incredible benefits to various fields, its misuse by fraudsters poses a significant threat. By staying vigilant, adopting best practices and leveraging technological solutions, individuals and organizations can mitigate the risks associated with AI-powered fraud. As technology advances, so must our awareness and defenses against the potential threats of innovation.",scam,Fraudsters are increasingly leveraging AI to enhance the efficiency and sophistication of their scams.
Investigating White-Collar Crimes: Legal Tools and Techniques,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=investigating-white-collar-crimes-legal-tools-and-techniques,"By: Stephanie Gordon This article is part of a three-part series spotlighting investigating white-collar crimes. White-collar crime, an insidious and complex category of offenses, extends far beyond the conventional image of criminal activity. Understanding white-collar crime is crucial for individuals and finance, law and security professionals in our interconnected world. This guide delves into the multifaceted landscape of white-collar offenses, illuminating the covert operations that underpin them. Understanding White-Collar Crime White-collar crime has serious consequences that go beyond financial losses, such as damaging the foundations of society. When public officials engage in corruption, people lose trust in the government. Securities fraud puts investments at risk, and embezzlement undermines the integrity of financial institutions. This guide to white-collar crime will teach you how to investigate these offenses. We will also discuss the tools and techniques used by organizations like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which lead to combating these hidden dangers. Securities Fraud Securities fraud is a white-collar crime involving fraudulent activities in the financial markets. It can range from the infamous Enron scandal, which shocked the world with its massive accounting fraud involving the manipulation of financial statements, to more recent cases of wire fraud and insider trading. Securities fraud perpetrators exploit the intricate web of financial systems for personal gain. The consequences of securities fraud can reverberate throughout the economy, leading to plummeting stock prices, ruined livelihoods and tarnished corporate reputations. Investigating securities fraud demands a deep understanding of financial regulations, forensic accounting and cooperation with agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to bring perpetrators to justice. Money Laundering Money laundering links criminal activity and legitimacy in the murky world of white-collar crime. This process allows perpetrators to conceal the illegal origins of funds, making them appear clean and legitimate. This crime reveals the harsh truth that these offenses frequently overlap, demonstrating how seemingly unrelated crimes, such as tax evasion or wire fraud, may be intricately linked in a web of financial deceit. Corporate Fraud A different kind of white-collar crime emerges within corporate entities' boardrooms and balance sheets. Corporate fraud entails schemes designed to defraud investors, shareholders and the public. High-profile corporate fraud scandals, such as the Enron scandal, demonstrate the devastating consequences of such deception on a global scale. Unraveling corporate fraud schemes necessitates financial acumen and legal expertise as investigators navigate complex webs of fraudulent transactions, counterfeit financial records and executive extortion. Intellectual Property Theft Intellectual property theft has become a prevalent white-collar crime in an increasingly digital age. Perpetrators may engage in counterfeiting, patent infringement or unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material. This white-collar crime is a prime example of how technology has expanded the landscape of illicit activities, demanding innovative investigative techniques to safeguard intellectual property rights.

The Hidden Storm: Understanding Fraud in the Wake of Natural Disasters,Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=understanding-fraud-in-the-wake-of-natural-disasters,"Natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires are devastating events that leave communities grappling with loss and destruction. While the focus is often on immediate relief and recovery, there is another aspect that frequently goes under the radar: the surge in fraudulent activities that exploit the chaos and vulnerability of these situations. In the aftermath of events like Hurricane Idalia and the wildfires in Hawaii, it is crucial to be aware of the various types of fraud that can emerge. The Many Faces of Disaster-Related Fraud Fraud in the context of natural disasters can take on multiple forms, each with its own set of challenges for victims and authorities. Here are some of the most common types: Charity Fraud In the wake of a disaster, the outpouring of generosity can be overwhelming. However, not all charitable organizations are what they seem. Fake charities often pop up to capitalize on the goodwill of people eager to help. These fraudulent entities collect donations but never channel the funds to actual relief efforts. A charity will never ask you to pay money for help, and neither will government programs, they should be reported to the FEMA Disaster Fraud Hotline toll free at 1-866-720-5721. Contractor and Repair Scams When homes are damaged, quick repairs are a priority. This urgency creates a fertile ground for contractor scams. Fraudulent contractors may offer to perform repairs at a low cost but either deliver shoddy work or disappear after receiving an upfront payment. Insurance Fraud Natural disasters often lead to a spike in insurance claims, making it easier for fraudulent claims to slip through the cracks. Some individuals or entities may exaggerate the extent of damage or file claims for properties that were not affected to receive payouts they are not entitled to. Other bad actors will act on behalf of an insurance company while having no association with the goal of stealing your personal information to commit identity fraud. How to Protect Yourself Verify Charities: Always check the legitimacy of a charity through trusted platforms or government websites before making a donation. Consult trusted platforms like the Better Business Bureau's Scam Tracker , Charity Navigator or Charity Watch for verification. Check Contractor Credentials: Before hiring anyone for repairs, verify their credentials, ask for references and never pay the full amount upfront. Consult Your Insurance Company: Before filing a claim, consult with your insurance company about the proper procedures to follow to ensure you are not inadvertently involved in fraud. Natural disasters are a time of upheaval and vulnerability, making them ripe for various types of fraud. By being aware of the risks and taking proactive steps, you can protect yourself and ensure that aid goes to those who genuinely need it. Whether it is the aftermath of a hurricane like Idalia or wildfires like those in Hawaii, vigilance and education are your best defenses against becoming a victim of fraud.",scam,"Contractor and Repair Scams When homes are damaged, quick repairs are a priority.

Public and Private Partnership in Information Sharing to Combat Fraud,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=public-private-partnership-information-sharing-to-combat-fraud,"By: Lin Danwan, CFE In recent years, fraudulent schemes have been on the rise, evolving constantly in their modus operandi. To counter this growing threat, information sharing mechanisms related to fraud detection and prevention have advanced significantly. Notably, an increasing number of fraudulent information-sharing initiatives are now adopting a public-private partnership approach, involving cooperation between government agencies, law enforcement and private sector entities. This collaborative model leverages the expertise and resources of both sectors to create a more comprehensive and effective response to fraud. Trend in Fraud Information Sharing: Public-Private Partnerships Traditionally, collaboration against fraud was confined to private actors, such as banks. However, the public-private partnership approach is now being increasingly utilized to combat fraud. Initiatives like, the Fraud & Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT) in Hong Kong and the Fintel Alliance launched by Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) in Australia, exemplify such joint efforts. In this model, public agencies possess legal authority and access to intelligence, while private companies hold real-time data and cutting-edge technologies. This accelerates information sharing, reduces response time and enhances the overall understanding of the threat landscape. Proactive measures can then be taken against fraud, leading to more cost-effective solutions. The partnership also seeks to adopt a more efficient and systemic approach with the support of information technology, as seen in initiatives like Financial Intelligence Evaluation Sharing Tool (FINEST) in Hong Kong. Challenges to Public-Private Partnership of Fraud Information Sharing While partnerships can be effective in combating fraud, they do come with some challenges that need to be addressed. It is essential to balance the liabilities and benefits of such partnerships, with some of the concerns easily noted including information security, protection of privacy interests and potential conflicts of interest. Data privacy concerns : Private companies often handle customer data carefully and share with government agencies only under specific regulatory requirements. Striking a balance between the purpose for fraud prevention and detection, and protecting individual privacy is uneasy and requires the establishment of a certain legal framework delineating the purpose and scope. Information security under this partnership : The scope of the shared information, the sharing channel or system, technical components that constitute the sharing solution necessitate deliberation and befitting technological development to ensure robust information security. Differing priorities and liability model : Public and private entities may have distinct proprietary concerns and nuanced priorities. Aligning these priorities and setting common goals is essential for effective collaboration. Legal and regulatory challenges : Many private companies operate with global jurisdictional coverage; the varying legal and regulatory frameworks complicate cross-border information sharing and cooperation. Accordingly, the solutions are expected to cover the below dimensions: Liability Model Setting Clear legal frameworks : Legal agreements and frameworks should be established, outlining the scope of information sharing, data protection, liability and the specific purposes for which data can be used. Roles and responsibilities : Establishing a partnership guideline to define the roles and responsibilities under the collaboration model is crucial to all stakeholders involved. Framework / Mechanism Setting Standardized data formats : Encouraging the use of standardized data formats and sharing protocols can simplify and streamline the exchange of information between public and private entities. Incident response plans : Developing incident response plans that involve both public and private stakeholders can ensure a coordinated and efficient response to fraud incidents. Public-Private dialogues : Collaboration can be strengthened by establishing regular forums and working groups where representatives from both sectors can meet and discuss common challenges and solutions. Reliable Technical Support Cybersecurity capacity building : Supporting capacity building programs for both public agencies and private companies can enhance their ability to detect, prevent and respond to fraud and cyber threats. An operable partnership requires rigorous model setting, defined roles and responsibilities, technical commitment and a shared understanding of the benefits of collaboration. With these in place, public and private sectors can create a more resilient and effective defense against fraud. By embracing the public-private partnership approach to information sharing, we can collectively stay one step ahead of the evolving fraud landscape and protect the integrity of financial systems worldwide.",money laundering,"Initiatives like, the Fraud & Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT) in Hong Kong and the Fintel Alliance launched by Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) in Australia, exemplify such joint efforts."
Don’t Get Hooked by the Geek Squad Phishing Scam,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=geek-squad-phishing-scam,"A new phishing scam preying on Best Buy customers is making the rounds. The fraudulent email claims to be from Best Buy's tech support team Geek Squad and tricks users into giving away personal information. Do not take the bait — this is what you need to know to avoid becoming a victim. The phishing attempt starts with an email appearing to come from Geek Squad , usually referencing a charge for hundreds of dollars on the recipient's Best Buy account to renew their Geek Squad membership. It prompts the user to call a phone number to cancel or renew their membership within 24 hours. If you call the phone number, they will ask for remote access to your computer under the guise of helping with your Geek Squad account. In reality, scammers can use it to install malware programs to steal private information. Unfortunately, this scam is quite convincing. The email contains official Best Buy branding and images, and the sender address appears legitimate at first glance. Even the web page mimics the real Best Buy login. However, telltale signs reveal the ruse for those who know what to look for. How to Detect and Prevent a Geek Squad Phishing Scam Contact Geek Squad if concerned. Use official contact info from the company website, not the information in the dubious email. Watch for poor spelling, grammar or unrealistic threats. Legitimate businesses typically do not make these mistakes. Inspect the sender’s email address. The fake messages come from accounts unrelated to Best Buy. Never give sensitive information or payment in response to an unsolicited email. Contact the company through official channels instead. If you shared personal or financial details, change passwords, alert your bank and continue to monitor for fraudulent activity. Do not click suspicious links or attachments as they have a high possibility of containing malware. Instead, login through BestBuy.com directly to check for any unusual activity. Use security software to detect and block suspicious senders. Report phishing attempts to the Federal Trade Commission at ReportFraud.ftc.gov and forward the email to reportphishing@apwg.org . This technique is not unique to Geek Squad. Cybercriminals constantly impersonate trusted brands via phishing to access consumer data and money. These scams recently involved major companies like Amazon, Apple, Chase Bank, Facebook, Microsoft and more. Stay vigilant to protect yourself from phishing. Crooks get craftier as security improves. But a little caution goes a long way in avoiding becoming their next victim. Do not take the bait with the Geek Squad scam or any other suspicious emails. Use secure practices to keep attackers at bay.",scam,"A new phishing scam preying on Best Buy customers is making the rounds.

For many companies and owners, this is unfamiliar territory, and most are unsure what to do once fraud is discovered. The Initial Steps As a business owner or executive, it is important to follow these initial steps in order to protect your company from fraud, as they are crucial to a successful investigation: Assemble your team of professionals. Once you suspect fraud has occurred within your organization, your first step should be lining up your team of professionals skilled in conducting fraud investigations. The team should be comprised of outside legal counsel, a forensic accountant and a computer forensic specialist. While in-house counsel and accounting staff may be included in meetings and discussions, attorneys and forensic accountants experienced in investigations can independently conduct interviews and perform analysis with a neutral perspective. For further consideration, an employment attorney can guide you on the appropriate and legal way to handle the suspected employee. The investigative team will define the scope of the probe, establish clear communication about the division of responsibilities and ensure compliance with legal and ethical requirements.  Investigators must collaborate with legal professionals to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations and rules of evidence. When selecting your team of professionals, certain skillsets should be considered, such as interviewing, financial analysis and data analytics, and potentially other technical specialties depending on the facts and circumstances. Forensic accountants and fraud investigators are trained to examine and analyze financial records. These records will include financial statements, bank records, transactional data and other relevant documents to identify irregularities, discrepancies or patterns indicative of fraudulent activities. Throughout the investigation, the team will likely need to interact, or possibly interview, key personnel within the organization and from various departments. Interviews play a crucial role in uncovering fraudulent activities. Interviewing witnesses, victims, suspects and relevant individuals can provide valuable insights, help corroborate evidence and aid in identifying potential perpetrators. Selecting a team of professionals skilled in interviewing techniques and behavioral analysis should be considered. Information should be distributed with care and consideration. In addition, the investigation team should establish confidentiality guidelines for all parties involved to prevent leaks and/or misinformation. Inform necessary parties. Once your organization learns of a substantiated fraud claim, certain parties should be notified of the investigation, such as your company’s board of directors, internal audit department, human resources and management. While certain key personnel may need to be informed about the allegations, your team of professionals may wish to keep most information related to the investigation concealed as they determine all involved parties, including if suspects were colluding together in the scheme. Another party that should be notified as soon as a loss is determined is your insurance company. For many organizations, their business insurance policy includes coverage for employee dishonesty or other coverage for fraudulent activity, known as fidelity or commercial crime insurance. To file a claim, you must notify your insurance carrier once a loss has been discovered. You will want to review your policy to ensure you adhere to the requirements necessary when filing a claim, such as the notification window and the company’s response once a loss is discovered. Further, your policy may include coverage for claims preparation which would reimburse the company for professional fees incurred to investigate and quantify the covered loss. Restrict suspect’s access. When assembling your team, ensure that you protect your organization from further damage by removing the suspected employee’s access to the company’s systems, corporate credit card and other physical assets. In addition, your human resources officer and employment attorney may advise you to place the suspect employee(s) on a leave of absence during the investigation before termination. Gather and preserve evidence. Gathering and preserving all evidence is crucial for possible civil and/or criminal court proceedings and potentially a fidelity insurance claim.  Investigators must promptly secure physical and electronic evidence while ensuring proper documentation, chain of custody and forensic best practices to maintain integrity and admissibility. This involves seizing documents, electronic data, conducting interviews, using specialized tools and capturing ephemeral messaging. Document investigative procedures and findings. Thoroughly document all actions, interviews, findings and evidence collected throughout the investigation. Comprehensive records of the investigation process support the development of a cohesive narrative and facilitates effective communication with stakeholders and legal authorities. The investigative team should compile a final report detailing the investigative process, interviews, witness statements, documents, financial analysis and recommendations for strengthening internal controls. Implement Recommended Corrective Measures. Investigative reports assess vulnerabilities and recommend corrective measures to strengthen internal controls. It is essential to leverage the lessons learned from each investigation to continuously improve fraud prevention and detection mechanisms, enhancing organizational resilience. Evaluate existing internal controls and security measures to identify any weaknesses that may have allowed the incident. Strengthen these controls to prevent future fraud and protect the company’s assets. Conducting a successful fraud investigation requires meticulous planning, thorough execution and collaboration among investigators, experts and legal professionals. Throughout the investigative process, it is important to handle the situation legally, professionally and ethically. By following the outlined steps and adhering to best practices, investigators can maximize their chances of uncovering fraud, mitigating losses and implementing preventive measures to safeguard against future fraudulent activities.",fraud investigation,"Fraud investigations are complex and multifaceted processes that require a systematic approach.

Too Good to be True? 4 Ways to Avoid Vacation Rental Scams,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=ways-to-avoid-vacation-rental-scams,"Booking a vacation rental online comes with the convenience of browsing listings from the comfort of home. But it also opens the door to scammers trying to take advantage of unsuspecting travelers. Vacation rental fraud often involves fake property listings, compromised accounts, bait-and-switch tactics, double bookings and other deceptive practices targeting short-term rental guests. Being aware of the common types of vacation rental scams and red flags can help you identify fraudulent behavior and even avoid becoming the victim. Common Types of Vacation Rental Scams Fake listings are among the most common vacation rental scams. Fraudsters create convincing listings for properties that either do not exist or are not actually available for rent. When an unsuspecting guest tries to book, the “host” collects payment and often ceases communication shortly after that. Account takeover scams involve fraudsters hacking into real rental accounts on sites like Airbnb or VRBO. They then change the listing details and rent out the property as if they are the real owner. By the time the actual owner finds out, the guest has already sent payment to the scammer. Bait-and-switch scams use fake photos of a luxury property to lure guests in. But when the guest arrives, the property is completely different, usually run down and nothing like what was advertised. Double booking scams happen when a host books the same rental property to multiple guests for overlapping dates. The guest who arrives last gets left scrambling when the home is already occupied. Red Flags of Vacation Rental Fraud Listings with limited photos, details and reviews, or that seem “too good to be true” should raise red flags. Also, be suspicious of prices drastically lower than comparable rentals in the same area. Fraudsters often target the most vulnerable in their schemes. By offering well-below-average prices on fake rentals, people who do not have much money to spend in the first place become targets for this kind of tactic. A host who pushes you to book or pay outside of the rental platform is another huge red flag. Legitimate hosts will have you book and pay through the platform, which offers protection. Contact info that differs between the listing and booking is also suspicious and should be verified through the platform primarily. Avoiding vacation rental fraud starts by understanding red flags of potentially fraudulent behavior. Anyone booking vacation rentals should always: Verify the host through the rental platform. Search the listing address to confirm it is a rental property, not someone’s residence. Always book and pay through the platform, not directly with a host. Use payment methods with fraud protections that are built in. Consider rental guarantee insurance that can reimburse you if fraud does occur. Before the trip, confirm all the details with the host again. This helps uncover any bait-and-switch schemes ahead of time. What to Do if You Are a Victim If you are the victim of a vacation rental scam, immediately contact the rental platform if you booked through one and dispute the charges with your bank or credit card company. You can also contact local law enforcement and file complaints with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) if the scam took place in the U.S. Victims might also consider reporting identity theft if any personal information was compromised. Once personal situations are addressed, it’s helpful to leave online reviews about the fraud to warn others of similar schemes on that particular property or even in the area. Being vigilant can help travelers avoid falling prey to vacation rental scams. Do your due diligence on listings, hosts and payments to ensure your next vacation rental experience is smooth sailing.",scam,But it also opens the door to scammers trying to take advantage of unsuspecting travelers.

Fresh Estate Fraud Case Unfolds In South Carolina,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=fresh-estate-fraud-case-unfolds-in-south-carolina,"By: Brett Darken A new estate fraud case is center-stage in South Carolina’s courts. The Palmetto state has been a hotbed of probate, trust and conservator fraud cases dating back more than half a decade: In March 2023, attorney Alex Murdaugh was convicted of murdering his wife and son. But years before the high-profile attorney was tried for murder, Murdaugh was tied to the disappearance of $4.2 million of his client’s insurance money, of which he was a trustee. Months before the Murdaugh trial, Russell Laffitte, the CEO of Palmetto State Bank, was convicted of fraud in federal court for using the money of his trust clients to make loans that were hidden from and did not benefit his trust clients. Court Authorized Fraud Probate, estate and conservatorship fraud presents unique challenges to fraud investigators. Estate investigations are cross-disciplinary and often involve the language of the law colliding with the numbers of finance and accounting. The new South Carolina case rises out of the estate of Carlos Hanna, who died in 2010. The estate has bounced around South Carolina’s courts for more than a decade, but it jumped into the headlines about six weeks ago when the family noticed that the court appointed conservator, Jeffrey Robinson, tried to sell the home of Georgia “Jo” Hanna out of Jo’s conservatorship— Jo is a dementia patient living in a memory-care facility. Robinson is the treasurer of Darlington County, South Carolina. On the side, he works as a financial advisor and fiduciary. In the Hanna case, Robinson had been appointed as the conservator of Jo by Darlington County probate judge Marvin Lawson. On April 18, 2023, attorney Charles E. Ipock wrote a letter to Judge Lawson. Ipock is a member of Haynesworth-Sinkler-Boyd, a law firm with more than 100 attorneys and multiple offices in South Carolina. On behalf of Robinson, Ipock asked Judge Lawson to issue an order to Robinson, as conservator, that gave the court’s approval to sell the house in which Jo Hanna lived before needing memory care. Ipock’s letter to Judge Lawson contained just two paragraphs. In it, Ipock writes: “As you will note, I request an Order of the Court without notice as allowed under South Carolina Probate Code.” Ipock then cited the section of South Carolina legal code that allows a conservator to do things “without notice.” In short, Ipock and Robinson wanted Judge Lawson to issue a court order without telling the family. Days later, on April 24, Judge Lawson issued the order as Ipock had requested: Judge Lawson approved Robinson’s request to sell Jo’s house “without notice.” Attorney Finds the Fraud Darlington County South Carolina has fewer than 70,000 people. It did not take long for the Hanna family to learn that Robinson, Ipock and Lawson had secretly agreed to sell Jo Hanna’s home and conceal the sale from the Hanna family. One of Jo’s children, Craig Hanna, and his wife Dana, contacted attorney Tucker Player in Columbia, South Carolina. Tucker Player’s keen eye for detail stopped the sale of the home “without notice.” Here’s how he did it: Non-Financial Deceptions Fraud is a unique type of theft because it is theft based on deception. In the Hanna case, the deception was unique: It wasn’t found in a brokerage statement, inflated invoice or a deflated appraisal. In this case, attorney Player found a subtle and sophisticated deception used by Ipock that twisted the language of South Carolina’s law. Player found that in Ipock’s motion to Judge Lawson, Ipock cited a specific statute in the code of South Carolina to support his request for an order “without notice.” The statute cited by Ipock deals with the actions of trustees and conservators (SC § 62-5-428). Clear as day, the South Carolina code says that conservators can ask a judge to issue orders “without notice” for a list of things. At first glance, attorney Ipock’s request appears to comply with the law. But Player drilled into the details of the legal code. He found that all of the things that can be done in a South Carolina conservatorship “without notice” are clerical or administrative events (e.g., Increase the bond, ask for an accounting; pay funeral expenses, etc.). As Player cited in his May 18 filing with the South Carolina Supreme Court: “Nowhere in this statute does it allow any court to dispose of property without notice. The only actions that can be taken without notice are those actions specifically enumerated….” Player’s granular dive into the legal code uncovered the deception in the real estate sale and his work delivered powerful results: Within days of filing his written complaint to the court, the sale was halted, and both Judge Lawson and conservator Jeffrey Robinson resigned from the case. Attorney Charles Ipock at Haynesworth-Sinkler-Boyd has not replied to emails seeking comment on the case, nor has Jeffrey Robinson. The Hanna estate has been open in South Carolina’s courts for more than a decade. Now that the forensic efforts have begun in earnest, the case will provide insights into the legal and accounting tricks used by financial predators to target their victims. It also will show how families and fraud fighters can defend themselves against fraud, embezzlement, theft and racketeering in their estates.

Fraud and Injustice: A Global Crisis in Indigenous Communities,Abbie Staiger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=fraud-and-injustice-global-crisis-in-indigenous-communities,"Indigenous peoples around the world face marginalization and exploitation, leading to increased vulnerability. This puts them at a particular risk for fraud, as opportunistic fraudsters take advantage of systemic inequalities. Fraud against indigenous communities is especially harmful due to the unique challenges these groups face. Factors like geographic isolation, lack of access to resources and cultural marginalization leave indigenous peoples vulnerable to exploitation in ways other groups may not experience. Recent cases showcase how fraud scams indigenous groups across the globe. Given the marginalization indigenous groups face, they often suffer from higher rates of poverty and lower access to health care and education. This leads to less awareness around fraud risks and fewer resources to recover from fraud harms. Geographic isolation also limits information sharing and support networks. Indigenous cultures face marginalization and dismissal within majority societies, allowing fraudsters to target them while avoiding scrutiny. Ultimately, fraud perpetuates the cycle of injustice experienced by these communities. Recent examples of this troubling trend: In the Navajo Nation, an identity theft ring targeted tribal members . Fraudsters used victims’ personal information to bill Medicaid for $12 million in fake rehabilitation services between 2016-2019. Many of the victims were elderly individuals who did not speak English, allowing the scheme to operate undetected for years. This scam diverted critical health care resources from an already underserved community. Some fraudsters misrepresent their indigenous identity for profit, known as “pretendians.” One notable example is Andrea Smith, a professor of Native American studies who was later exposed for not having the Cherokee heritage she had claimed. She exploited her fictional identity to obtain grants, speaking engagements and other opportunities intended for indigenous peoples. Such fraudulent actions allow scammers to profit from marginalized identities while taking resources from authentic indigenous communities. In Australia, there is a concerning rise in scams that specifically target Aboriginal communities. Tactics include high-pressure sales, offers of free prizes and unauthorized withdrawals from bank accounts.  Aboriginal communities are particularly susceptible to these schemes due to language barriers, financial inexperience and geographic isolation. Additionally, there is often stigma associated with reporting such incidents, coupled with a general distrust of authorities, making it challenging for victims to seek assistance. This combination of factors enables scammers to operate with near impunity. Another insidious tactic involves fake indigenous organizations or charities to solicit donations. For example, the “Saskatchewan Indigenous Cultural Centre,” was a fraudulent organization that falsely claimed on its website that it represented 60 First Nations bands. The site requested donations for educational programs that didn’t exist. These fraudulent groups take advantage of the public’s goodwill towards indigenous causes, ultimately embezzling funds. (CBC, 2023) These examples illustrate the diverse nature of fraud against indigenous groups, all of which have disproportionately large impacts due to the social, economic and political marginalization these communities endure. Addressing the root causes of fraud is essential to its prevention. This might involve improving delivery of health care, promoting financial literacy, increasing internet access or fostering greater trust between authorities and indigenous people. Through more thoughtful solutions, we can combat the exploitation of vulnerable communities and create a more just society.",scam,Recent cases showcase how fraud scams indigenous groups across the globe.

A Positive Step for British Banks and Shared Information,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=british-banking-and-shared-information,"By: Tony McClements, Head of Investigations at Martin Kenney & Co (MKS) Reuters recently reported that more than half a dozen British banks were in advanced talks with law enforcement and government agencies over plans to systematically share intelligence on major financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorism financing. Two landmark pilots are expected to launch within months. The moves follow Britain recently launching a new economic crime plan and a national fraud strategy as the country grapples with the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and London’s previous unenviable reputation as “ Londongrad . ” The agreement in the offing between the banks, including Lloyds and NatWest, will create protocols and systems for sharing information should be broadly welcomed. The objective of this proposal is summed up succinctly by Simon Fell, vice chair of a parliamentary anti-corruption group, who said, “So, any new mechanisms to share information that could help track down criminals, while respecting sensible privacy rights, is welcomed.” The information held by banks is quite rightly considered sensitive and demands firewalling. This data provides a deep insight into an individual’s or corporate entity’s most private information. However, there are instances where this right to privacy is exploited by the unscrupulous. The reliance on confidentiality can be manipulated by the corrupt, tax evaders, drug dealers and even terrorists. Banks are in the money-laundering frontline, an invidious situation where they can often never do right for doing wrong. When it spots something dubious, the normal response is for a bank to generate a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). However, SAR systems in most countries, especially the U.K., are overrun and failing in their law enforcement objective. Banks are spending vast sums complying with their regulatory obligations, only for the intelligence they generate through SARs to disappear into an information black hole that is the SAR regime. Where is the system failing? It is difficult to apportion blame. Banks often generate “defensive” or “just-in-case” reports. Given the severity of potential sanctions, it is difficult to criticize banks for adopting this position. Unfortunately, such reports can often clog up the system, generating a situation where it is difficult to see the “wood for the trees.” Likewise, law enforcement has had to cut its cloth to adjust to severe budgetary constraints. These limitations mean that a large number of SARs, which could otherwise generate meaningful and useful intelligence, slip through the cracks. Even when the banks submit a “good” SAR, there is no guarantee that it will see the light of day in a policing context. The SARs system is flawed, but it can also never be perfect due to the human factors inherent within the system. It should be emphasized that what may be suspicious to one person is not necessarily considered shady by another. In addition, the banks also suffer, as does law enforcement, from corporate and geographical boundaries that create silos. These repositories can unintentionally create a situation where the left hand does not know what the right is doing. In law enforcement, this can result in “blue-on-blue” scenarios, where the same suspect is being investigated by multiple agencies—all oblivious to one another’s investigations. It shouldn’t happen, but it does. The banks are no different: Unless they can liaise with one another, the jigsaw will never be complete. Being able to secure this overview is essential. Yet the fear of breaching privacy laws has prevented banks from speaking to one another, even when they have had good cause to do so. The key phrase for me in these new measures is “respecting sensible privacy rights.” It makes sense to me that those in the inner circles of banking should be able to establish an information exchange. As long as the information is not being disclosed outside of the finance members’ tight network, there should be no need for concern. If a number of banks have a customer common to them all, and all are suspicious for similar or even different reasons, then the resultant SAR will carry with it much more significance and gravitas. The mere fact that several banks will now combine efforts to raise concerns should push that SAR towards the top of the law enforcement in tray. Yet the mechanics of this information-sharing plan are unknown. Indeed, several of the banks are refusing to comment or even confirm their participation in the trial. To my mind, empowering the process by which banks will be able to lawfully liaise with each other and share their concerns needs to be formalized as soon as possible. The banks will benefit from being able to discuss developing situations. Law enforcement will benefit from enhanced intelligence. And the SARs system will potentially benefit too, as the number of SARs should decrease — even if only marginally — as only one report would be generated, rather than several SARs all highlighting the same individual. All in all, I consider this proposal to be a positive step in the fight against financial crime and money laundering.",money laundering,"By: Tony McClements, Head of Investigations at Martin Kenney & Co (MKS) Reuters recently reported that more than half a dozen British banks were in advanced talks with law enforcement and government agencies over plans to systematically share intelligence on major financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorism financing.

Fake Documents are on the Rise—Here are 3 Trends to Watch,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=fake-documents-trends-to-watch,"By: Ronan Burke, CEO of Inscribe Anna Sorokin, the so-called “fake German heiress” (perhaps better known by her alias Anna Delvey), came dangerously close to duping a hedge fund out of $25 million. According to The New York Times , she intended to defraud the financial institution by creating fake bank statements in Adobe Photoshop, a task that she said took “surprisingly little time.” She’s not alone: image-editing tools like Photoshop are popular among fraudsters because they make it easy to alter information on financial or identity documents like bank statements, utility bills, W-2s and more. Combine that with the fact that fake ID marketplaces and bank statement generators are only a Google (or TikTok) search away, and it’s not hard to see why cases of document fraud rose by 79% in 2022. Mitigating this risk has become more urgent than ever for financial institutions. In recent research that Plaid conducted with more than 400 lending leaders, 61% say they have experienced document fraud —making it the most significant type of fraud they’ve experienced. But document fraud can be difficult to detect. Alterations are often nuanced (such as changing the name of a transaction on the fifth page of a 90-day bank statement) and many fraud signals are invisible to the human eye (like details about when the document was last edited, which are hidden in the metadata). Thankfully, data from processing millions of documents can shine a light on the most popular document fraud tactics being used by fraudsters today. Keep reading for three trends from the “ 2023 Document Fraud Trends Report ” to watch out for this year. Trend #1: First-party fraud is as prevalent as ever One of the most surprising trends uncovered from reviewing documents in 2022 is that, in many cases, fraudsters actually are who they say they are. Third-party and synthetic ID fraud have understandably gained a lot of attention over the past few years; synthetic identity fraud, alone, resulted in $20 billion in losses for U.S. financial institutions in 2020. And according to the 2023 Identity Fraud Report , a little more than half (51%) of all fraud incidents in financial services were categorized as identity fraud (meaning false identity details were used by fraudsters). But what about the other half? While many fraudsters are using fake or stolen identities to carry out their schemes, about half (45%) of the fraudulent documents detected did not include alterations to identity details. Instead, these individuals were using their real identity to engage with a bank, but falsifying information like income, cashflow, bank balance and other financial details to increase their chances of approval or attain larger lines of credit. In order for organizations to defend against this first-party fraud and credit abuse, they need to have multiple checkpoints for potential customers to pass before they’re granted a loan or line of credit. So just because someone passes an identity document check, it’s critical to still check the legitimacy of any financial documentation they provide as well. Trend #2: Fake documents have become easier to acquire Fraudsters who need a fake financial document for a credit card or bank account application don’t have to look very hard: bank statement templates, document generators, “novelty” document providers and more are only a few clicks away. Perhaps even more concerning, many fraudsters have adopted a community mindset, leveraging social media platforms like Reddit, Telegram and TikTok to share techniques, tips and templates for successfully committing document fraud. When a fraudster is able to fool a financial institution with a fake document, they share that document template with others. In fact, the number of fake or fraudulent document templates being used has skyrocketed in recent years. Last year alone, the number of templates detected tripled, with more than 100 unique templates being flagged in a single week— meaning that more than 100 distinct, unique document templates were identified; the total volume of all document templates detected was often in the thousands for a single week. If fraudsters are sharing tips and tricks, then fraud investigation teams can too. More and more organizations are creating dedicated spaces (like a Slack channel or wiki) where investigators can pinpoint noteworthy fraud incidents, discuss edge cases or get a second opinion from their other team members on whether something looks like a template they’ve seen before. Trend 3: Fraudsters are thinking big … and working weekends When it comes to which documents fraudsters choose to use when attempting to fly under the radar, you might guess that they’d focus on ones from smaller institutions, like regional banks and credit unions. Since investigators are likely unfamiliar with these institutions, and their financial statements, they would also be less likely to spot a fake. In reality, that’s not the case. Data shows that the highest fraud rates include documents that claim to be from major financial institutions, like Bank of America, Wells Fargo and TD Bank. And ubiquitous documents like W-2s and CP-575s are also among the most commonly falsified. Another interesting data point uncovered is that the most common days of the week for fraudulent documents to be submitted were Sunday and Saturday, respectively. What does this mean for your document review process? When you come across certain tax documents, bank statements or applications submitted on Sundays, don’t just assume that they’re legitimate because they seem innocuous and familiar. That’s what fraudsters hope you’ll do. Instead, if something feels off or looks suspicious, be sure to flag these documents and give them a closer look. Preventing document fraud in 2023 and beyond Eventually, Ms. Sorokin was caught and sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for her crimes, but not before conning banks, hotels and a private jet company out of an estimated $200,000. Her case illustrates how even when fraudsters are caught, it’s often only after they’ve been able to do substantial damage. Hopefully, sharing these fraud trends helps strategically inform fraud prevention strategies for 2023. When financial institutions arm themselves with knowledge, they can outsmart fraudsters.",fraud investigation,"If fraudsters are sharing tips and tricks, then fraud investigation teams can too."
The U.K.’s Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill,"Samuel May,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=uk-economic-crime-and-corporate-transparency-bill,"The U.K.’s Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill made its way through the House of Commons and, more recently, the House of Lords. As the bill approaches becoming law and faces only a few final steps before being law, an analysis of details and slated changes is timely. According to the U.K., the bill is supposed to deliver reforms to Companies House (the British executive agency that maintains the register of companies), reforms to prevent the abuse of limited partnerships, additional powers for law enforcement agencies, reforms to give businesses more confidence to share information in order to tackle money laundering and other economic crime and new intelligence gathering powers for law enforcement and removal of nugatory burdens on business. For fraud examiners, the bill is host to potentially significant changes to certain operations and functions. Specifically, the bill would: Introduce provisions that could hold corporations criminally liable if they fail to prevent employees or associated persons from committing economic crimes (such as fraud, money laundering or bribery). Improve the sharing of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) between financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, ostensibly to enhance detection and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Require additional identity verification for all new and existing registered company directors, people with significant control and individuals who deliver documents to the government. Grant additional powers to U.K. law enforcement agencies to seize and recover digital assets that are associated with illicit activity (money laundering, fraud and ransomware are specifically mentioned). The House of Lords made changes to include seizing crypto in terrorism cases . Perhaps the most interesting of the changes, and potentially the most controversial, is the new “failure to prevent fraud” offence. Organizations will be held liable where a specified fraud offence is committed by an employee or agent, for the organization’s benefit and the organization did not have reasonable fraud prevent procedures in place. The U.K. Factsheet on this offense specifically states that “it does not need to be demonstrated that company bosses ordered or knew about the fraud.” This stands in contrast to the United States promotion of corporate compliance programs and fraud prevention through the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations, which allows for the government to reduce or eliminate punishments for organizations if they follow the guidelines. Regarding digital assets, the provision relating to the seizure of crypto appears to be just one part of a larger regulatory push by various U.K.  agencies that have produced reports concerning the future of crypto and how the U.K. should move forward in creating new, or implementing existing, regulations to combat illicit use. The U.K., however, still wants to be a “ global hub for cryptoasset technology .” The new Economic Crime bill builds on a series of other U.K. laws that have been introduced in the past decade. Mentioned specifically by the U.K. Factsheet, this bill follows on the heels of the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) 2022 Act (ECTE). The ECTE focused on sanctions and overseas entities and was a reaction to the global economic results of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Prior to that, the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act, designed to allow the U.K. to issue its own economic sanctions and implement FATF standards, was passed in 2018. While the full impact of this new law will only be known once law enforcement and prosecutors get the new tools in their hands, the Economic Crime bill could see a significant upheaval in the anti-fraud landscape in the U.K.","bribery, money laundering","According to the U.K., the bill is supposed to deliver reforms to Companies House (the British executive agency that maintains the register of companies), reforms to prevent the abuse of limited partnerships, additional powers for law enforcement agencies, reforms to give businesses more confidence to share information in order to tackle money laundering and other economic crime and new intelligence gathering powers for law enforcement and removal of nugatory burdens on business.

Protecting the Disabled Community from Fraud,Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=protecting-disabled-community-from-fraud,"As we commemorate the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it's crucial to reflect on the progress we've made and the challenges that still lie ahead. One such challenge is the prevalence of fraud schemes that disproportionately affect the disabled community . Understanding the Threat Fraud schemes targeting the disabled community are unfortunately widespread and diverse. They range from identity theft, financial scams, healthcare fraud to disability benefits fraud. These schemes often exploit the vulnerabilities of disabled individuals, such as their reliance on assistance programs or their potential isolation from society. Identity Theft Identity theft is a common form of fraud that affects many, but it can be particularly devastating for disabled individuals. Disabled individuals are often targeted because they may rely on caregivers or other third parties to manage their finances. Scammers may steal personal information to apply for credit, file taxes or even get medical services. The Federal Trade Commission provides resources on how to protect against identity theft and what to do if you become a victim. Financial Scams Financial scams often involve tricking disabled individuals into giving away their money or personal information. These scams can take many forms, including lottery scams, romance scams or investment scams. The scammers often prey on the victim's trust and goodwill and take advantage of their financial situations. Healthcare and Disability Benefits Fraud Healthcare fraud involves the misuse of the healthcare system for financial gain. This can include billing for services not provided, misrepresenting non-covered treatments as necessary medical procedures or prescribing unnecessary medications. Disability benefits fraud involves individuals or organizations falsely claiming disability benefits. It can also involve service providers overcharging for their services or providing unnecessary services to increase their profits.

The Evolution of Check Fraud,Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=check-fraud-evolution,"Around two millennia ago, human civilizations began employing financial mechanisms akin to today's checks. Such tools included the prescriptions of Ancient Rome, the Adeshas of Ancient India and the letters of credit utilized by Ancient Persians. To circumvent the issues of carrying bulky coin pouches and potential theft, Arab merchants devised the sakk, a paper instrument that facilitated the deposit of money in a bank in one country and its withdrawal in another. During the 16th century, cashiers in the Dutch Republic began accepting deposits for a charge and disbursed funds to anyone bearing a note from the depositor. This system expanded across Europe over the ensuing centuries. However, due to all notes being manually inscribed, fraudulent activities were prevalent in the forms of forgery, theft and counterfeiting. This situation was so problematic that many regions prohibited this modern mode of payment. This was later circumvented by the use of unique check paper by financial institutions. As criminals identified and exploited the system's flaws, the sophistication of check fraud only increased. As fast as a speeding...horse? In 1762, British banker Lawrence Childs pioneered the use of the first printed checks to navigate the issue of forgery and counterfeiting. This inadvertently created opportunities for new forms of check fraud such as check floating, also known as ‘check kiting’, paperhanging and chemical alternation. In instances of check floating, fraudsters would take advantage of the “floating period,” the time between when a check is tendered and when the money is collected by the receiver from the financial institution, using a bad check which will not be cashed as the checking account does not have sufficient funds to cover the payment. At this point in history, the float period was substantially longer as communication between financial institutions was limited by our methods of travel, no faster than a speeding horse. Checks on acid From the late 1700s to the present, acid has been a societal issue, but not that kind of acid. With the invention of printed checks, scammers would use the chemicals they had on hand, like common household cleaners, to chemically alter checks, “washing” them to remove and then change the payable information. This issue has remained a rampant problem and still has no solution to date; in fact, it is estimated that check washing costs individuals, businesses and financial institutions more than $815 million in losses per year . Banks have instituted the use of high security checks to deter fraudsters and it is recommended businesses use a security pen, which has ink that is not dissolvable by the common chemicals used in check washing. However, these are added costs and even if used, they are negated by mobile check depositing. The creation of MICR In the mid-20th century, banks recognized the need for a more secure and efficient system to process checks and combat fraud. This led to the development of Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) technology, which significantly reduced check fraud and enhanced efficiency in check processing. MICR, pioneered by Stanford Research Institute and General Electric Computer Laboratory in the 1950s, uses special ink that can be read by machines, encoding vital information like the bank's routing number and the account holder's account number on the check. The implementation of MICR technology streamlined the check clearing process, making it faster and more accurate, while also providing an additional layer of security against counterfeiting and forgery. The unique magnetic properties of the ink made it difficult to alter or replicate the printed characters, thereby reducing the prevalence of check washing and other forms of chemical alteration. Check fraud today Modern day check fraud involves several common methods. Check kiting, or 'floating checks', still persists. Paperhanging is another prevalent type, where checks are written on closed accounts. Check washing, counterfeiting and forgery, often using sophisticated printing technology, are common, and finally, there's identity theft, where a criminal impersonates the account holder, often obtaining the account holder's checks or even creating counterfeit checks with the victim's account information. Cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly important issue with online banking and digital checks, where hackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information and perform fraudulent activities. Despite all of the advancements in security measures in our modern era and through the long history of check fraud, the creativity and sophistication of fraudsters continue to pose significant challenges.",scam,"With the invention of printed checks, scammers would use the chemicals they had on hand, like common household cleaners, to chemically alter checks, “washing” them to remove and then change the payable information."
Updating AML Compliance Programs: Integrating FinCEN’s Priorities,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=updating-aml-compliance-programs-integrating-fincen-priorities,"By: Adil Raza As the landscape of financial crime continues to evolve, financial institutions must stay vigilant and prepared to address emerging risks. In this regard, aligning anti-money laundering (AML) programs with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) AML Priorities becomes crucial. This article explores the significance of integrating the FinCEN AML Priorities into AML programs and provides step-by-step suggestions to ensure preparedness for regulatory examinations. Understanding the FinCEN AML Priorities The FinCEN AML Priorities serve as a regulatory framework for AML compliance. In its inaugural list issued on June 30, 2021, FinCEN outlined several priorities that financial institutions should consider. These priorities include corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational criminal organization activity, drug trafficking organization activity, human trafficking and human smuggling, and proliferation financing. The Impact of Selected FinCEN AML Priorities Corruption As one of the FinCEN priorities, corruption poses significant risks to the integrity of the financial system, undermining fair competition, distorting markets and eroding public trust. Financial institutions must combat corruption as part of their AML programs, as corrupt practices facilitate money laundering, capital flight and illicit financial flows. Fraud Fraud encompasses a wide range of deceptive practices, including identity theft, money mule schemes and Ponzi schemes. Fraud poses a significant threat to financial institutions, both in terms of financial losses and reputational damage. To mitigate the impact of fraud on financial institutions, AML compliance programs should focus on proactive fraud prevention, early detection and swift response. Transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) TCOs engage in various illegal activities, such as drug trafficking, human trafficking and human smuggling, and weapons smuggling. These organizations exploit the global financial system to launder their illicit proceeds. The substantial funds generated from transnational criminal activities can have a distorting effect on local and global economies. Illicit funds infiltrate legitimate sectors, undermining fair competition, market dynamics and investment opportunities. Financial institutions may unknowingly become conduits for transnational criminal activities. Criminal organizations use sophisticated methods to move illicit funds across borders, making it challenging for financial institutions to detect and prevent their involvement. When financial institutions are unwittingly used in money laundering schemes or become victims of fraud perpetrated by transnational criminals, they can suffer financial losses, damage to their reputation, regulatory penalties and legal consequences. Human trafficking and Human smuggling Human trafficking and smuggling present grave humanitarian issues with significant financial implications. Human smuggling generates substantial illicit profits that criminals seek to legitimize through money laundering. Financial institutions may inadvertently become channels for laundering these funds, allowing criminals to integrate illegal proceeds into the legitimate economy. Money laundering associated with these activities can lead to reputational damage, regulatory non-compliance and legal repercussions for financial institutions. Cybercrime Cybercrime refers to criminal activities conducted through digital means, targeting computer systems, networks or individuals for financial gain or disruption. Financial institutions and their customers are prime targets for cyberattacks, which can lead to financial losses, reputational damage and erosion of customer trust. Integrating FinCEN AML Priorities into AML Programs To effectively integrate the FinCEN AML Priorities into AML programs, financial institutions should consider the five key steps outlined below: Step 1: Gap Analysis Performing a comprehensive gap analysis is the first step towards preparedness. This analysis evaluates the alignment of existing AML programs with the FinCEN AML Priorities, identifying areas that require improvement or adjustment. Step 2: Aligning Components of AML Programs Financial institutions should integrate the FinCEN priorities into various components of their AML programs, such as policies and procedures, risk assessment methodologies, customer due diligence processes, transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting protocols. These updates ensure the AML program explicitly addresses the FinCEN AML Priorities and provides guidance to employees for detecting and reporting suspicious activities. Step 3: Strengthening Governance and Risk Management Senior management should engage actively in aligning AML programs with the FinCEN AML Priorities, providing clear direction and support for implementing necessary changes. Establishing strong governance frameworks, enhancing risk assessment methodologies and highlighting resources and controls based on the identified AML priorities are essential steps in strengthening governance and risk management. Step 4: Leveraging Technology and Data Analytics Leveraging advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics can optimize AML programs. These technologies enhance the detection and monitoring of suspicious activities related to the FinCEN AML Priorities, identify patterns and anomalies and automate manual processes. Network analytics can aid in uncovering complex relationships and hidden connections, helping identify sophisticated money laundering schemes or fraud networks. Step 5: Establishing a Continuous Improvement Culture Continuous monitoring, internal audits, independent reviews and promoting communication, training, and awareness among employees is critical to establishing a continuous improvement culture. These efforts ensure the consistent adherence to AML policies and procedures, reinforce the importance of detecting and reporting suspicious activities associated with the FinCEN AML Priorities and provide valuable insights for program enhancement. Conclusion By aligning AML programs with the FinCEN AML Priorities, financial institutions demonstrate their commitment to combating financial crime and promoting a safer and more transparent financial system. Corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational criminal organization activity, human trafficking, smuggling and proliferation financing are all significant concerns that require dedicated attention. Financial institutions that integrate these priorities into their AML programs strengthen their governance frameworks, leverage technology and data analytics and foster a culture of continuous improvement are better prepared to address the evolving risks posed by these priorities and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.

Fraud Perspectives: Nonfungible Tokens,"Kate Pospisil,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=fraud-perspectives-nonfungible-tokens-nfts,"In the third webinar of the Fraud Perspectives series, presented by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) and The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), Mason Wilder, Research Manager at the ACFE, chatted with Kishan Patel, CIA, CITP, CPA, and Chris DeAngelis, CFE, about nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and their role in the current anti-fraud landscape. A confusing and often abstract concept, NFTs have made headlines recently as an innovative new technology with the potential to revolutionize various industries. While NFTs offer numerous benefits, such as increased security and unique ownership, they also present new fraud risks. Understanding these risks and how to mitigate them is essential for organizations that are considering investing in NFTs. What is an NFT? NFTs are assets that have been tokenized via a blockchain, and these digital, programmable transactions on the blockchain allow anyone to see the transaction flow. Following the digitization of many aspects of our daily lives, NFTs offer a way to tokenize anything of economic value, including branding and marketing, loyalty and rewards programs, event tickets and passes, identity and access management, data management and more. NFTs are considered more of a collectible asset than a security, and anything that can be put into a smart contract can be used for NFTs. Fraud Risks Associated with NFTs Several primary fraud risks are associated with NFTs, including money laundering, fake or counterfeit NFTs, intellectual property theft, shilling (multiple parties colluding to pretend interest to drive price) and cyber theft in general. Additionally, the burden of proof on art ownership is low, making it difficult to authenticate and prevent theft. Furthermore, rug pulls and airdrop scams are two common NFT-specific schemes that raise a new set of challenges for both auditors and fraud examiners. Rug pulls involve developers hyping a project to attract investors, then the scammer disappears with the invested funds. Air drop scams involve the promotion of a user receiving an exclusive NFT drop that requires them to connect their digital wallet, which is then drained. One of the main challenges of NFTs for auditors and fraud examiners is how to assess their value on a balance sheet. Experts suggest looking at comparable assets in the marketplace, contract history, the price people are willing to pay, rarity of the asset and whether an NFT has held its value since its original purchase. Without regulatory guidance, it is difficult to determine the actual value of an NFT. Additionally, the vast array of applications for NFTs makes it challenging to define regulatory guidance. Despite their perceived security with transaction histories available on a public blockchain, both Patel and DeAngelis agree that the potential for fraud risks is always present when dealing with NFTs. According to DeAngelis, “It’s hard to define something at the beginning of its lifecycle as truly good or truly bad … if there’s a way to use it [badly], it’s probably going to happen.” Patel added, “Permissionless, trustless technology … will always be susceptible to bad actors.” Controls and Best Practices The volatility of cryptocurrency is a significant red flag that may indicate that an NFT is being overvalued. Auditors should verify how the value is being claimed and whether that value has held, increased or dropped over time. A further cause for concern is the lack of required control, cooperation and compliance regulations, which make NFTs susceptible to many forms of manipulation. Implementing standard best practices is a critical step in controlling NFT fraud risks. Good know-your-customer (KYC) practices, continuous monitoring of digital wallets and regular digital wallet hygiene are essential controls to mitigate fraud risks. An extra layer of identification in the creation of a wallet, such as multi-factor authorization, and transacting in a safe environment is highly recommended. The Future of NFTs Entering the NFT space from a fraud-fighting perspective requires a foundation of understanding from blockchain to crypto to NFTs. To get started, consider taking blockchain courses, understanding smart contracts, picking up coding skills (especially Python) and building a foundation of understanding — you need a solid beginning to successfully advance in an evolving NFT environment. New experts are emerging who have gone through specific training to help auditors navigate NFTs and blockchain technology. For instance, "" Know Your Meme "" uses proprietary tools and investigations to determine the creators of memes, which can help prevent intellectual theft. Determining the underlying currency that supports an NFT and monitoring the lifecycle of the NFT itself (collectible or art) can also aid auditors in navigating the NFT space. NFTs have numerous potential current and future use cases, including branding and marketing, loyalty programs, customer engagement with ""techiness,"" commercial and mainstream applications, and the increase of digital money becoming the norm. In conclusion, while NFTs might ebb and flow in use cases moving forward, as they have since their inception, they also present a unique set of fraud risks that organizations, auditors and fraud examiners must be aware of.

Antwerp’s Diamond Trade: A Brilliant Tale of Risky Business Practices,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=antwerp-diamond-trade,"By: Clarisse Persia, CFE Secretive and exclusive, Antwerp has been the heart of the global diamond trade since the 15th century when the Belgian city was the commercial heart of Europe, with 40% of world trade crossing its ports via old trade routes connecting Venice to Lisbon. According to the Antwerp World Diamond Center (AWDC), about 1,700 companies and 4,500 traders concentrated in an area of about one square kilometer trade 84% of all rough diamonds worldwide . Although facing competition from India and the Middle East, Antwerp’s multi-million-dollar deals are still concluded with a handshake and the Yiddish words “mazel und broche” (“luck and blessing”). Are we certain diamonds are a blessing for all? Tax Avoidance Files obtained in the Swiss Leaks by French newspaper Le Monde and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that, in the early 2000s, HSBC’s Swiss unit helped 2,000 diamond traders avoid taxes by shielding their assets. In 2014, a Belgian prosecutor charged HSBC's Swiss unit with fraud, money laundering and criminal conspiracy for advising its clients — mostly in the diamond industry — to set up offshore accounts in Panama and the British Virgin Islands to hide their assets from taxes. A few of these HSBC diamond clients , including Richard Davidovici, Kenneth Lee Akselrod and Mozes Victor Konig, were already wanted by Interpol for financial crimes in Russia. In January 2021, The Brussels Times reported that a trial began involving 14 unnamed persons accused of laundering diamonds profits to avoid paying taxes. Conflict Diamonds Between the 1990s and 2000s, Antwerp hosted high-profile cases involving the smuggling of conflict diamonds that fueled civil wars in Africa. The world’s first trial involving conflict diamonds was held before Antwerp’s Criminal Court in 2004, which involved an investigation into the Nassour and Ahmad families for smuggling conflict diamonds from Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Antwerp. Diamond dealer Aziz Nassour was sentenced to six years in prison, and their Belgian company Asa Diam was ordered to pay a customs fine for not declaring diamonds. The Swiss Leaks also reported about Omega Diamonds BV that agreed to pay a USD 195 million civil settlement in 2013, after a former employee blew the whistle about the company laundering arms money. Terrorism Financing After the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States, accusations of terrorist financing through the diamond trade was added to the ones relating to the trade in conflict diamonds. According to a 2007 report by the think tank RUSI , al-Qaeda managed to establish a diamond trading post centered in Liberia, which also controlled diamonds mined in Sierra Leone, while Hezbollah operated predominantly in the Ivory Coast. In 2004, Nassour and his cousin, Samih Ossailly, were also charged for financing al-Qaeda, but these charges were deemed unfounded by Antwerp’s Criminal Court . In 2002, The Guardian claimed that before 9/11, al-Qaeda managed to convert USD 10 million into untraceable gems. Sanctions on Russian Diamonds Amid the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, news sources reported that jewelers including Tiffany, Richemont and Signet pledged not to buy Russian diamonds — even if they were transformed outside of the country. Despite the war in Ukraine, official Belgian statistics showed that Belgium still imported EUR 676 million worth of Russian diamonds in the second quarter of 2022. Resistance from Antwerp has been perceived as the main reason for the EU’s backtracking when approving an import ban from Russian state-owned diamond producer Alrosa in October 2022. In January 2023, the Financial Times reported that introducing sanctions could cost 10,000 jobs and that other countries were ready to profit, according to AWDC. Regulatory Framework and Emerging Risk According to a 2013 FATF report , diamonds are a risky business due to their multi-jurisdictional trade routes, tracing difficulties and their high liquidity. After the Fowler report (2000) denounced Antwerp’s lax controls in the diamond trade, Belgium, as part of the EU, had an active role in establishing the Kimberley Process in 2003 to prevent the trade in conflict diamonds. In 2017 , the AML legislation came into force, and in 2019, a Royal Decree introduced new AML rules such as the submission of criminal records for the company/senior officers and UBO disclosure. It is to be seen if these regulations can shield Antwerp’s diamond traders from the city’s rising reputation as Europe’s “ Cocaine capital .” In 2020, operation “Cash Travel” revealed how vulnerable the diamond industry is to drug cartels.",money laundering,"In 2014, a Belgian prosecutor charged HSBC's Swiss unit with fraud, money laundering and criminal conspiracy for advising its clients — mostly in the diamond industry — to set up offshore accounts in Panama and the British Virgin Islands to hide their assets from taxes."
Leading the Way on Recovering the Proceeds of Corruption,Martin Kenney,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=leading-the-way-on-recovering-the-proceeds-of-corruption,"The head of Peru's judiciary, Javier Arévalo Vela, recently publicly highlighted Peru's success in recovering the proceeds of corruption and related financial crimes through its non-conviction based forfeiture law, Extinción de Dominio . The subsystem Peru has rolled out to implement the law “allows the state to recover money from cases of corruption, money laundering and more,” Vela said at a recent conference run by the Swiss organization, the Basel Institute on Governance . Around $64 million has already been recovered, with many more cases in the pipeline. This all highlights the inroads Peru is making into fighting corruption through non-conviction based forfeiture. Many developed states have similar laws designed to frustrate those who would pilfer the public purse, but there will be others wondering if such legislation is advantageous, if it does not already exist: the answer should be a resounding “yes.” Legislation of this type removes the need for lengthy and expensive criminal investigations that will likely fizzle out, leaving the wrongdoer to hang onto illicit gains. By implementing a process using the civil-law burden of proof, the state can right the wrong and ensure that crime does not pay. There may be those who find this premise draconian and unfair, who see such a process as being in conflict with human rights and open to abuse. If you have significant wealth and assets, it should be straightforward to account for these if asked to do so. It’s unlikely that you can be a civil servant earning $60k per annum and have a private yacht berthed off Monaco; however, if you do, then you should be able to evidence the derivation of this wealth. However, the concern that there is the potential for abuse of process by a rogue state is also valid. History is littered with examples of political opponents falling foul of those in power and being stripped of their assets. The question is, then, do we rule out such powers for the many on the basis that a few may abuse them? There is no easy answer to this quandary. My perspective is that a rogue state will abuse its citizens and political opponents regardless of whether there is a law in place allowing non-conviction based forfeiture. However, those countries with the willingness to embrace the notion that corruption is wrong and that it needs addressing can be guided in developing legislation that fits the bill and, as importantly, shown how these powers need to be wielded fairly and justly. Therefore, the Basel Institute and its partners should be congratulated on their efforts, as must the Peruvian government and judiciary who are embracing change and making a difference on behalf of their people.",money laundering,"The subsystem Peru has rolled out to implement the law “allows the state to recover money from cases of corruption, money laundering and more,” Vela said at a recent conference run by the Swiss organization, the Basel Institute on Governance ."
Case Study: Decoding the Cobweb of Letter of Credit,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=decoding-the-cobweb-of-letter-of-credit,"By: R Sumitra, CFE, MBA Recently, I worked on a case wherein a loan account of a bank turned bad, otherwise known as a non-performing asset. A preliminary investigation was conducted to know the genuine reason for the degradation of the loan account. The allegations included the diversion of the fund by the borrower, trade-based money laundering (TBML) through letters of credit and improper monitoring of the account by the bank. How the Auditor Carried Out the Investigation First, the auditor requested data on letter of credit and analyzed the transactions during the past years. While reviewing the letter of credit transactions, the auditor created a master profile that included the purpose of the letter of credit, names of the transporters, the total amount, etc. The auditor conducted public domain searches on the suppliers and noted the names, addresses and related parties of the supplier. The auditor then performed transaction testing from the bank account statement of the borrower. Finally, the auditor checked the ""Terms & Conditions of Sanction"" to know the purpose and justification for granting a letter of credit facility. Based on the above analysis, the auditor noticed the following issues in the suspected borrower’s account: There were inconsistencies in the issuance of the letter of credit with that of the purpose mentioned in the letter of sanction. The beneficiaries of the letter of credit (i.e., the supplier) and the suspected borrowers were related parties. As per the records, the supplier's registered office and the suspected borrower's warehouse were the same. During the preceding year a total of 135 letters of credit amounting to USD 73.33 million had been devolved. Upon verification of the trade license number and trade tax number of the supplier in the public domain, it was found that the numbers were cancelled three years prior. The auditor also visited the address mentioned in the supplier's proforma invoice and made a discreet enquiry about the company. It turns out that no such company existed. The company befooled the bank using fake documents. As the investigation continued, the auditor visited the office of the transporter at the address mentioned in the lorry receipts, which required a serial number identifying the transport company. No such transport operator existed at the address that was listed. On perusal of the account statement of the suspected borrower, it was found that there were frequent credits of amounts from the suppliers' accounts to the suspected borrower's account. In addition, such transactions were more frequent after the issuance of a letter of credit. The suspected borrower company was dealing in plastic commodities, whereas the suppliers were a dealer of iron and steel rods, revealing even more inconsistencies in the trade activities and additional evidence of money laundering through letters of credit. Red Flags to Identify Money Laundering Through Letters of Credit When investigating fraudulent activity as it relates to letters of credit, the following red flags are important to explore during the preliminary investigation: Over-invoicing or under-invoicing of goods. Goods shipped to the buyers are misrepresented on the official document. Noticeable change in the scale, volume and frequency of transactions, or a sudden change in the behavior of the customer. The discrepancy between invoices and descriptions of the goods in the document. Shipments routed through multiple unconnected subsidiaries without a valid reason. Payment methods are inconsistent with the value of transactions. Shipments are made to or from an unusual location. The types of goods traded under the letter of credit are not in line with the regular business activity of the client. Goods being shipped under letter of credit are not clear, and hence, difficult to determine the value of. Complex transaction structuring. Round-tripping of funds. A high volume of transactions with the related parties. Documents submitted with incomplete information. Red flags are detection scenarios that call for further investigation and should be escalated as per guidelines, even if the transaction otherwise appears in order. It is essential to understand the red flags for preventing fraud, which can be unlocked through continuous monitoring and creating awareness by investing in the learning and development of employees.",money laundering,"The allegations included the diversion of the fund by the borrower, trade-based money laundering (TBML) through letters of credit and improper monitoring of the account by the bank.

As part of the Internet Archive , a non-profit digital library founded in 1996, the Wayback Machine contains a historic log of an estimated 735 billion web pages, making it an incredibly powerful database supporting a range of businesses and industries. In 2017, a second circuit court of appeals in New York upheld challenges from Fabio Gasperini , an Italian computer hacker who was convicted of misdemeanor computer intrusion. Screenshots from the Wayback Machine were entered as evidence in the case against him, confirming that websites he ran tied him to the virus and botnet scam for which he was convicted. Gasperini appealed, contesting that the screenshots could not be legitimate or verifiable, which was debunked following confirmation from an Internet Archive employee on their authenticity. This ruling paved the way for this type of evidence to be used in securing future convictions, which remains a valuable tool for fraud investigations. One of the main ways that the Wayback Machine can be used in fraud investigations is by identifying changes made to a website or web page. For example, if a company is suspected of fraudulently altering information on their website, investigators can use the Wayback Machine to view the historical record of that website and identify any changes that were made. This can include changes to pricing information, product descriptions or other important information that may be relevant to the investigation. The Wayback Machine can also be useful in fraud investigations by providing evidence of fraudulent activities. If a company is suspected of engaging in false advertising or misrepresenting their products or services, investigators can retrieve historical records of the company's website or web pages, which may reveal evidence of misleading claims or false information. In addition to identifying changes and providing evidence of fraudulent activities, the Wayback Machine can be used to identify potential witnesses or accomplices. With a range of website designers, content creators or other individuals who may be involved in maintaining web pages over many years, investigators can use the Wayback Machine to identify individuals who were involved in the creation or maintenance of the website or web pages in question. Not only can the Wayback Machine be used to investigate fraud, it can also be used to prevent it. For example, banks and financial institutions can use the Wayback Machine to monitor the websites of potential clients or partners. By checking the historical content of these websites, banks can identify red flags early in the vetting process to protect their institutions from fraudulent activities. However, the Wayback Machine is not foolproof. Some websites may use robots.txt files, for example, to block the Wayback Machine from archiving their content or use other methods to hide or modify their historical content. The Wayback Machine only archives publicly accessible websites, so it may not be useful in investigating fraud that occurs on private or encrypted platforms. In conclusion, the Wayback Machine can be a powerful tool in fraud investigations. It allows investigators to access historical evidence of website content and structure, which can help them identify and prosecute fraudsters. While the Wayback Machine is not an end-all for fraud prevention, it is an important tool that can be used by law enforcement agencies, financial institutions and other organizations looking for another opportunity to protect themselves and their clients from fraud risks.","fraud investigation, scam","Screenshots from the Wayback Machine were entered as evidence in the case against him, confirming that websites he ran tied him to the virus and botnet scam for which he was convicted.

Fraud Talk: Confessions of a Fraudster,Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=fraud-talk-confessions-of-a-fraudster-charles-antonucci,"In this episode of Fraud Talk, the ACFE's Chief Training Officer John Gill sat down with Charles Antonucci, the former president of The Park Avenue Bank, who was convicted in 2015 of trying to defraud the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Antonucci also pleaded guilty to other charges including self-dealing, bribery, embezzlement of bank funds, and a multi-million fraud scheme involving an insurance company. The ACFE does not compensate convicted fraudsters. In this excerpt, Charles Antonucci speaks about running The Park Avenue Bank during the Great Recession: Charles : We grew the bank immediately from-- I think the first year we went from 25 million to 100 million. We used broker deposits as a tool. Then within the first three years, we were close to 400 million. I built the branch in Borough Park. I built another one in Bay Ridge, particularly catering to the Orthodox community. We were moving along pretty well. Until 2008. [chuckles] The proverbial [beep] hit the fan. We were in the real estate business. 80% of our loans were real estate loans, either the bridge loans or loans that we made directly. The first crack was when the Wall Street firms started collapsing. We had preferred stock in Fannie Mae at the time. When Fannie Mae failed, we lost-- I think it was $5 million, which triggered another series of events. Dropped our capital ratio below 10% and we had to be at 10% because we had broken deposits. We're up [beep] creek, so to speak. We met with the regulatory organization. We went down, we met with the superintendent. We said, ""Listen, here's our problem. We got 200 million of broker deposits maturing over the next three months. My capital ratio is below 10%. I can't meet the requirement, but we'll go out of business. We'll liquidate. We need to raise $5 million to keep this thing afloat."" Basically, he said to me, ""Do whatever you got to do, but we don't want to see you fail. We've gone out of our way to put you in business and we don't want to see you fail."" What I heard was, ""We don't really give a [beep] where you get the money. Just get it."" So I did. Listen to the Full Episode","embezzlement, bribery","Antonucci also pleaded guilty to other charges including self-dealing, bribery, embezzlement of bank funds, and a multi-million fraud scheme involving an insurance company."
AI Fraud: The Hidden Dangers of Machine Learning-Based Scams,"Laura Harris,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=ai-fraud-the-hidden-dangers-of-machine-learning-based-scams,"Artificial intelligence (AI) itself is not inherently fraudulent. AI is a field of computer science that focuses on the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human-like intelligence, such as learning, problem solving and decision making. AI technologies are used in a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, language translation and image recognition. However, like any technology, AI can be used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes. There is the potential for AI to be used to facilitate fraudulent activities, such as  generating fake or misleading information, or automating scams or other fraudulent schemes. AI can also be used to detect and prevent fraud by analyzing data and identifying patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity. Machine learning is a subfield of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data and improve its performance over time. Machine learning has already made a significant impact in a variety of fields, including computer science, finance, healthcare and transportation, and it is expected to continue to play a major role in the future of AI and other emerging technologies with the development of new algorithms and approaches that can enable machine learning systems to perform more complex and sophisticated tasks. The use of AI in fraud depends on how it is implemented and used. Individuals and organizations should be aware of the potential risks and take appropriate measures to protect themselves from fraudulent activity, whether it involves AI or other technologies. There are a few reasons why someone might use AI for fraudulent purposes: Speed and efficiency: AI can process large amounts of data and perform tasks quickly, which makes it a potentially useful tool for automating fraudulent activities. Anonymity: AI can be used to carry out fraudulent activities without leaving a traceable human trail. Evasion of detection: AI can be used to generate fake or misleading information that is difficult for humans to detect as fraudulent. Personal gain: Fraud is often motivated by a desire to obtain financial or other benefits through deceptive or dishonest means. AI can be used as a tool to facilitate this type of activity. Generating fake or misleading information: AI could be used to create fake websites, social media accounts, or other online content that is designed to deceive or mislead people. This could include generating fake reviews or manipulating online ratings to mislead consumers. Automating scams: AI could be used to automate scams or fraudulent schemes, such as by sending out mass emails or text messages that are designed to trick people into revealing sensitive information or sending money. Spoofing phone numbers or email addresses: AI could be used to create fake phone numbers or email addresses that are designed to deceive people into thinking they are communicating with a legitimate entity. Generating fake documents: AI could be used to create fake documents, such as contracts or invoices, that are designed to mislead or deceive people. Automation of scams: AI could be used to automate scams or fraudulent schemes, such as by sending out mass emails or text messages that are designed to trick people into revealing sensitive information or sending money. Evasion of detection: AI could be used to evade detection by generating fake or misleading information that is difficult for humans to identify as fraudulent. This could make it more difficult for authorities to identify and track down cybercriminals. Increased sophistication of attacks: AI could be used to increase the sophistication of cyber-attacks, such as by generating more convincing phishing emails or by adapting to the defenses of targeted organizations. Impersonation AI systems can be used to impersonate a real person in a number of ways, depending on the specific context and the capabilities of the AI system in question. Here are a few examples of how AI could be used to impersonate a real person: AI systems can be trained to generate text or speech that is designed to mimic the style, tone, and language patterns of a particular person. This could include generating social media posts, emails, or other forms of written communication that are designed to sound like they were written by a verified source. AI systems can be used to generate images or videos that are designed to look like a particular person. AI systems can be used to manipulate online profiles or accounts to make them appear more like the person being impersonated, including changing profile information or generating fake activitiy on social media or other online platforms. The use of AI to impersonate a real person can be a highly sophisticated and effective form of deception, and it is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the potential for this type of activity and to take steps to protect themselves from it. There are a few ways you can tell the difference between writing produced by a person and writing produced by AI. Here are a few things to consider: Style and tone: AI-generated writing may lack the subtle nuances and variations in style and tone that are characteristic of human writing. It may also contain repetitive or formulaic language. Grammar and syntax: AI-generated writing may contain errors in grammar and syntax that are less common in human writing. Cohesion and organization: AI-generated writing may be less cohesive and less well-organized than writing produced by a person. It may lack transitions or logical connections between ideas. Context and content: AI-generated writing may be less contextually relevant or may contain content that is unrelated to the topic at hand. It is important to note that the capabilities of AI in generating human-like writing have improved significantly in recent years, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between writing produced by AI and writing produced by a person. In some cases, it may be necessary to use multiple methods or to consult with experts in order to determine the source of a given piece of writing. There are a number of steps that individuals and organizations can take to prevent AI-assisted fraud. Some recommendations include: Implement strong security measures, such as using unique passwords for all accounts, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping all software and security protocols up to date. Be cautious about sharing personal information. Be selective about the personal information you share online and be cautious about responding to requests for personal information from unknown sources. Verify the authenticity of information and communications. Be skeptical of information and communications that seem suspicious or too good to be true and take steps to verify their authenticity before acting on them. Educate yourself about the common signs of fraudulent activity, such as unsolicited requests for personal information or offers that seem too good to be true. Report suspicious activity. If you suspect that you are the target of fraudulent activity, or if you come across suspicious information or communications, report it to the appropriate authorities or organizations. By following these recommendations, you can help protect yourself and your organization from AI-assisted fraud and other forms of cybercrime. ACFE Training Director, Jason Zirke, CFE, used AI to write the following anti-fraud poem: A deceitful act, a moral waste Lies and tricks for personal gain Leaving others in financial pain From identity theft to Ponzi schemes Fraud takes on many different means It preys on those who trust and believe Leaving them hurt with no relief It lurks in shadows, waiting to pounce It preys on those who don't keep an ounce Of skepticism, or trust too much Falling victim to its wicked touch But fear not, for justice will prevail The guilty will be sent to jail They’ll pay for their crimes, that much is true Fraudsters can’t escape their due So, report the fraud and don't be shy Seek help, don't let the fraudster by Stand up and fight, don't let them win Together we can stop this sin Have you enjoyed this article written by AI, but arranged by a human?

Case Study: The Employee and Vendor Nexus,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=case-study-the-employee-and-vendor-nexus,"By: Mohit Jain, CFE Recently, I worked on a case wherein a whistleblower raised allegations on two employees that the company was engaging in unethical practices. The allegations included bribery and corruption, conflict of interest, breach of code of conduct, misappropriation of assets, high prices and poor quality of products supplied and abuse of position. While the whistleblower had not indicated the names of employees in the whistleblower letter, they mentioned the name of the department of the company under which such unethical practices were being followed. An auditor conducted the preliminary investigation based on the whistleblower letter. How the auditor identified the employees and carried out the investigation The auditor requested the purchase data of the department in question and started analyzing the transactions conducted during the past years. Next, they created a detailed profile of the employees working in the department. During the review of transactions with the vendor, the auditor performed transactions testing of the vendors using samples and requested the supporting documents required, as per company policy, such as purchase requisition, quotation, comparative statement, goods receipt note, gate pass, invoice, payment voucher and any other supporting available for the transaction. The auditor performed analytics on the vendor master of the company and listed the type of vendors, such as existence of vendor, turnover of the vendor over the years and type of products supplied by the vendor. The auditor conducted public domain searches on the vendor and noted the owner of vendor, address of the vendor, related parties of the vendor, establishment date of vendor firms, etc. The auditor also performed fuzzy logic on employee master and vendor master based on scenarios like common name, common address, common phone number, etc. Based on the above analysis, the auditor listed the suspected vendors and reviewed all the transactions of the suspected vendors to identify the potential wrongdoings. The auditor noticed the following issues in the suspected vendor’s analysis: Conflict of interest between vendor and employee, wherein employee’s spouse was the partner in the suspected vendor’s company/firm. Communications indicating vendor favoritism by the employee, such as preferential treatment of payments to suspected vendor and quotation only obtained from suspected vendor. Sharing of confidential information with the suspected vendor. Kickbacks by the suspected vendor to employee family member’s account. Inexistent manufacturing facilities declared by the suspected vendor at the time of onboarding (Site visits on the manufacturing facilities revealed the results.) Based on the above findings, the auditor prepared the questionnaire and interviewed the employees indulged in unethical practices. The top red flags to identify corruption in the organization include: 1. Red flags to identify corrupt vendor/supplier: Supply poor quality of goods despite no questions raised, or they are continually awarded the work. Charges unjustified high prices or raises additional cost invoices frequently. Offers inappropriate gifts or provides lavish business entertainment. Close nexus with an employee (Address of supplier/vendor matches with the employees address or employee's relative address, know-your-customer [KYC] documents of vendor match with the employee's KYC), etc. Provides an incomplete address or contact details. Provides multiple addresses. Works with competitors and passes confidential information to the competitor in exchange for awards/contracts. Has various companies in the same industry and uses them for bid rigging. Displays indicators such as poor performance record, history of fraudulent contract, family ties with an employee, lack of qualification or experience, etc. Although detecting and preventing vendor fraud is not easy, identifying key areas where there is a lack of control and implementing stronger controls and measures can go a long way in preventing vendor fraud cases. 2. Red flags to identify corrupt employee: Lifestyle is not commensurate with the income earned. Forces subordinates to bend the rules for personal gain. Circumstances arise that generate extreme personal pressures, such as ill family members, huge personal liabilities, etc. History of not filing conflict of interest forms or Global Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) declaration. Close association with suppliers. Inclination to make excuses for deficiencies in supplier's products or services, such as poor quality, late deliveries or high prices. The presence of one or two red flags does not necessarily imply the presence of wrongdoing and may highlight some other external pressure or challenge exists in a person’s life. Understanding and recognizing red flags is an important fraud prevention strategy and can be unlocked through investing in regular fraud awareness education for the employees.",bribery,"The allegations included bribery and corruption, conflict of interest, breach of code of conduct, misappropriation of assets, high prices and poor quality of products supplied and abuse of position.

Cyber Week Scams,"Samuel May,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=cyber-week-scams,"The growing trend of shoppers preferring pajamas and pumpkin pie to cold weather and crowds reached an all-time high in 2021 as online shopping for the holiday season soared due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, global online sales again hit a new high of $281 billion during Cyber Week (Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday); that figure was up 2% from the pandemic season, according to Salesforce , with Cyber Monday alone accounting for $11.3 billion in online sales, according to Adobe Analytics . Black Friday, by comparison, reached $9.12 billion in online sales and reportedly light foot traffic. This year was also novel for how customers made their purchases: for the first time ever, most online sales were made through mobile devices. Mobile sales accounted for 44% of all sales last year but reached 51% in 2022. As for how customers made their way to their purchase, 28% of online orders originated from a paid search, 18% were from customers going directly to retail websites, 17% from clicking a link in an email, and 15% originated from an organic search. (Paid searching is defined as an organization paying for a prominent position on search result pages versus organic searching where the organization optimizes their website’s visibility to appear in search results more “naturally.”) So, what do all these numbers mean for fraud examiners? Scam artists typically take the path of least resistance and follow the money. Early results from Cyber Week 2022 saw average suspected digital fraud attempts increase 82% over the earlier part of the year. TransUnion analytics estimate that 15% of all global e-commerce transactions between November 24 and November 28 were potentially fraudulent. Fraud examiners should make every attempt to plan ahead and work on prevention through education. Looking toward 2023 with 2022 already in the books, a few recommendations can be made: Email Scams Virtually every cybersecurity educational resource will remind individuals to dutifully check each email they receive for telltale signs of deception and to avoid clicking included links or downloading attached documents. Even in ideal scenarios, email scams and phishing attempts still succeed from time to time. During the busiest sales days of the year, where every email inbox is bombarded with dozens and dozens of temptations, customers will be even more vulnerable. The same techniques fraudsters use to get individuals to click into a phishing scam are employed by companies wanting to boost their end-of-year figures. Last chance! Buy now! Deals you can’t afford to miss! Cybersecurity professionals can take a bit of solace in this year’s figures. While 17% of sales came from individuals clicking through an email link, 18% took the effort of going directly to their preferred site. The message is getting through, but repetition is important. One well-crafted email scam is all it takes for a Grinch to spoil a holiday season. Text Scams Text scams are somewhat new, but they’re similar to email scams. Customers should be educated on avoiding following links in instant messages or downloading attachments or images from unknown sources. With the rise of mobile sales, companies and scam artists alike are more frequently sending out text messages to entice customers to click. This includes messages for upcoming deals, fake order messages, fake delivery messages and all manner of other communications. Customers should be advised to, once again, avoid clicking, calling or engaging with text messages and go directly to the website they ordered from to resolve any alleged issues. Fake Websites The highest percentage of online sales were driven by paid searches and/or sponsored links. Generally, these are legitimate companies that have put money toward appearing on the top of the page when particular phrases are searched. Such a large piece of the online sales pie will also inevitably attract fraudsters looking to perpetuate a larger scam; all that is required is an upfront investment to get their link to the top of the page. As with all online advertisements, customers need to be reminded to resist the initial temptation to click. While some organizations put significant effort into curating and verifying advertisements or sponsored content that appears on their website, not all of them put forth the same effort or fully succeed in filtering out bad actors. A bad ad can lead to a fake website where victims give up their credit cards or identifying information in pursuit of a good deal. Organizations can help combat Cyber Week sales fraud by preparing for an increase in account takeovers and fake profiles. They can monitor important data trends like declined transactions and projected sales volume increases from broadcast deals in order to understand how to best protect their customers. This holiday season is sure to set more records for fraud commensurate with the increase in sales and spending. While the customer is ultimately responsible for protecting themselves from phishing, identity theft, or any of the myriad of e-commerce scams, fraud examiners can work to anticipate increased vulnerabilities and help to educate customers and organizations. Despite our culturally agreed upon practice of ignoring our weight during these food and festival filled months, an ounce of prevention is still worth a pound of cure.",scam,"Scam artists typically take the path of least resistance and follow the money.

Case Study: Overseas Contractor Bribed Official to Defraud the U.S. Government,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=case-study-overseas-contractor-bribed-official-to-defraud-us-government,"By: Eduardo Cuyos, CPA, CICA, DCFM3 A few years ago, I worked overseas as the director of internal audit and investigation. The organization’s headquarters had seven other support organizations to protect U.S. territory and resources. The director of the moral, welfare, and recreation (MWR) received funding from the federal government to take care of soldiers, civilian employees and their families for all recreational and morale booster activities. One of the latest programs was the Warrior Adventure Quest (WAQ) Program. WAQ was developed by the Army Medical Department; it is an Army RESET training tool designed to introduce soldiers to activities that serve as alternatives to aberrant behaviors often associated with accidents involving recently re-deployed soldiers. This tool presents coping outlets to help soldiers realize their own new level of normalcy after deployment and move on with their lives. An investigation into fraudulent activities was turned over to me after three other independent investigators did not satisfy the leadership of the results. A joint team from the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) and the Department of Defense Inspector General (DODIG) conducted the previous investigation prior to my involvement. The DCIS and DODIG did not pursue the investigation, as they only calculated a $25,000 fraud committed, which was below their threshold of $100,000. The DCIS and DODIG started their investigation in April 2015 up to the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2015. A whistleblower came forward in March 2015 by one of the employees who worked side by side with the contractor and his staff in the same office at the MWR Director’s building. How my team calculated $611K loss due to fraud My team and I conducted research of the program and found out it started overseas in January 2013.  I requested information from the MWR director, a primary POC for the investigation, and the chief of finance and accounting department, whose office was in the headquarters. I requested three years (January 1, 2013–September 30, 2015) of computer/system-generated GPC purchases; all key supporting documents (KSDs), including vendors’ invoices and WAQ attendance rosters; and three years of GPC purchase journals from six geographically separated GPC cardholders. Boxes and boxes of KSDs arrived in our office and I distributed each year of transactions to three members of my auditor staff. I tasked them to examine each day of purchases and KSDs, then note discrepancies and suspicious transactions, and reconcile their Excel worksheets with the computer-generated printout and the journals from the six cardholders. Data analytics is of utmost importance in any financial fraud investigation. Here were the major red flags: Collusion and bribery between the MWR outdoor activities chief and the contractor were the major causes of fraud. $110,024.93: In 2013, MWR chief of outdoor activities requested funding from San Antonio HQs in Texas for the paintball equipment and supplies in the amount of $110,024.93 EFT to the contractor’s local bank account. Upon examination of the contract, the contractor was personally responsible for the equipment set up and supplies. $240,385.00: Group discount for WAQ outdoor activities typically costs $40 per sport and $50 for other sports. These sports included rock-climbing, bungie jumping, ATV, zipline, white water rafting, skiing and paintball. The contractor charged $60 and $70 per soldier attendee. Group discounts collected by the contractor for the three-year period totaled $240,385.00. $168,595.95: The contractor and his staff were provided access to the soldiers’ database for all military, families, and Department of the Army (DA) civilian employees and their families. The contractor and his staff inflated attendees, forged signatures, or provided copies of attendance rosters and changed the dates of events, amounting to $168,595.95. $73,351.01: GPC requests for payment that did not have any signed rosters totaled $73,351.01. $18,959.52: Uncovering a number of ghost outdoor bus trips was the result of meeting a retired soldier, who was in the same building as our office, during a smoke break. I learned that for geographical bachelors (senior and junior enlisted soldiers without family with them and lived in the barracks), they cannot drive locally. So, the only transportation that is available is two MWR tour buses; the chief of transportation was directed to provide MWR trips for these soldiers. We received 257 PDF files, converted those files into 42 Excel pages, sorted by days and months, and reconciled that data with the Excel payments worksheet. A total of $18,959.52 in fake attendance rosters were paid, but there were no outdoor activities that took place on those dates. A total of $611,316.41 in fraudulent payments was made to the contractor, which was way above the $25,000 calculated by the joint team of the DCIS and DoDIG, and far exceeded the $100,000 threshold. Non-financial information (NFI) is as crucial as the financial information in fraud detection. Here is some of the financial information that was crucial and highly contributed to the success of the investigation: Location Set-Up : The chief of the MWR Outdoor Activities office was on the second level of the building. He had three staffers, and their office was on the first level. The contractor and his three staff were also located at the first level and worked side by side, so there was no segregation of duties and accountabilities. The Appearance of Same Team : The contractor bought Starbucks coffee and breakfast pastries for all, treated all lunches occasionally and bought matching winter outfits for everyone. MWR Chief Approved All GPC Requests for Payment: The contractor had all GPC requests approved by the chief. He had a handheld card reader and would go to all the different local national (LN) GPC cardholders and collect payments. LN cardholders had no choice but to pay the contractor as all GPC requests were already signed/approved by the chief. LNs did not question their authority. Christmas Holidays: Most of the soldiers went home to their families during Christmas. However, the attendance rosters presented were the same number as during the summertime. Summer vs. Winter: ATVs, white water rafting, zipline, and other sports are popular in summertime but not normally happening during wintertime. However, they were shown to have “occurred” during unusual times. Trends and Patterns: We plugged in the fraud trend that started within three months of the program in 2013, which increased through the end of 2013, and peaked in 2014. Fraud significantly declined after the whistleblowing in March 2015. The joint investigation conducted by the DCIS and DoDIG teams covered the investigation after the whistleblower and did not start from the inception of the WQA program in January 2013.

"Old Tactics, New Landscape",ACFE Staff,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=old-tactics-new-landscape,"By: Bruce Dorris, J.D., CFE, CPA We get them every day, multiple times a day. Most contain misspelled words that easily reveal the emails are fake. But that’s not the case with all of them. I’ve seen plenty of sham emails and advertisements that look authentic and made me think twice before deleting them. CFEs have a good eye for these scams and can usually spot them quickly. But sometimes the language and graphics are so convincing that they fool even the most skilled observer. The Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group, recently pulled off one of the biggest cryptocurrency thefts of all time using just such a technique. This issue’s cover article — “Fraud and the North Korean cyberthreat,” by Patrick Westerhaus, CFE — illustrates that fraudsters can trick even the best and brightest using rogue emails or advertisements. The financial ecosystem may be getting more complex, but fraudsters are still using basic social engineering tactics to give them access to computer systems. It’s simple deception, perhaps. But it’s effective, and con artists have been using similar methodologies since time immemorial. What’s new, however, is how these skilled manipulators navigate what’s an ever-changing cyberworld and one that brings new challenges for fraud investigators. Cybercriminals may not be completely invisible, but they operate at much faster speeds than “traditional” fraudsters. They can deplete an organization’s digital coffers in seconds. That’s breathtaking when you consider that the median duration of a fraud — the typical time between when a fraud begins and when it’s detected — is 12 months, according to Occupational Fraud 2022: A Report to the Nations . To make matters worse, cryptocurrency tumblers or mixers — a service that allows fraudsters to make anonymous digital transactions even more anonymous — raise the stakes and increase the challenges for CFEs trying to trace these illicit funds. These advances demonstrate why it’s so important to build up our internal controls, especially IT, and train our staff accordingly. When it comes to internal controls, we must fully equip ourselves because these criminals know where our vulnerabilities are. As Westerhaus writes, “Criminals get away with so much fraud because no one is watching closely enough to correlate what they’re seeing.” Our mission of training CFEs to understand the mindset of this new type of fraudster is more critical than ever. “Cyberfraud is all about the human behavior of criminals and victims,” says Westerhaus. The better we understand cybercrime and the people who perpetrate such frauds, the better job we can do to prevent it.

"Member Spotlight: Alex De Genaro, CFE",Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=member-spotlight-alex-de-genaro-cfe,"Alexandre De Genaro, CFE, realized he was on the right path when he garnered his first confession during a fraud investigation. After spending time in information security and loss prevention, De Genaro is now the Head of Business Security, Latin America for General Mills. How did you become passionate about fighting fraud? I was supporting the global investigation team in a local incident, and I got my first confession. It was a case involving a senior logistics manager with more than 15 years at the company. He borrowed a large amount from one of the carrier’s providers but was unable to pay and eventually reported. With the necessary elements, we obtained his confession, but that was very striking for me. I had not yet come across a case of conflict of interest at this level, especially in the private sector where there was not much publicity in the media. That's when I started to research and understand the potential for losses and the pain caused to businesses, which, without proper attention, could be severely compromised. How did you get to your current role? I am a lawyer, and I started working with information security for a telecommunications company, dealing with breach of confidentiality, telephone interception, and helping law enforcement in investigations of greater offensive potential. After a few years at the head of this department, I received an offer to be the loss prevention manager of an electronic equipment assembly company. I learned that a strong reactive program (research) is an essential part of prevention—after all, even if the deviation is not initially identified, when the corrective action is effective, it ends up generating a preventive culture. This concept made me give the necessary emphasis to the subject and seek training and improvement in this sector. What are challenges you face in your role? In addition to the most common ones, such as lack of structure and organizational culture, I can say that certain investigations reach hierarchical levels that become an enormous political challenge. Aligning expectations within the business itself is also a challenge. The sense of necessity and the way to investigate, but mainly the weight that a fraudulent action has, varies greatly from country to country, from culture to culture, and even from team to team. What is normal practice for the sales team may be unacceptable for the finance team, for example. This creates a challenge, not just for the company, but also an internal challenge for each decision maker. In my particular case, leading the investigation, I seek clarification of the facts in an impartial way so that the business can make the best decision, but this exemption needs to be set aside when I act as member of the company's compliance committee. What is an important lesson you’ve learned in your career? Be very careful where you step. It may feel firm—it may even be firm—but it's best to touch your toes before jumping into unfamiliar terrain. The evidence can lead you to logical conclusions, but, in general, there are gaps that, if we are not attentive, can be filled improperly. It is important to be very clear about the division between facts and presumption so that we do not create lines of reasoning based on false premises. I also learned the value of having a program with training, periodic reports to senior management, review of the company's code of conduct, business involvement in the most conflicting issues, and the importance of the collegiate decision and the Ethics and Compliance Committee, especially with the diversity across sectors. Finally, I learned that patience and respect for the organization's rhythm are fundamental to the application of a solid and effective program. Trust and culture change are obtained with a lot of resilience, impartiality and transparency, but it is also necessary to understand that this takes time to achieve. What is important to you about being a CFE? Being a CFE brought me the necessary rationale to authenticate methods, tactics and techniques that I learned and improved along this path. However, I need to highlight the importance of the strategic planning vision for the Fraud, Investigations and Compliance Program that certification makes you understand, plan and apply.",fraud investigation,"Alexandre De Genaro, CFE, realized he was on the right path when he garnered his first confession during a fraud investigation."
Why the U.K. Should Follow the U.S.'s Whistleblowing Lead,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=why-the-uk-should-follow-the-us-whistleblowing-lead,"By: Tony McClements Whistleblowing can be a testy subject, but I believe it is potentially one of the most powerful weapons in our anti-money laundering (AML) arsenal. Anyone watching countless cop shows and movies will be all too aware of the value that an insider brings to an investigation. In the U.K., these “snouts,” as they’re called, are treated very differently than their U.S. counterparts. In the U.S., whistleblowers can stand to make a lot of money from their disclosure. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provides an insight into the difference: “The Commission is authorized by Congress to provide monetary awards to eligible individuals who come forward with high-quality original information that leads to a Commission enforcement action in which over $1,000,000 in sanctions is ordered. The range for awards is between 10% and 30% of the money collected.” This notion of incentivizing the whistleblower process does not sit comfortably in the U.K. I have long advocated for the U.K. to follow the U.S. model. Anybody who makes the decision to embark upon becoming a whistleblower knows that it will likely cause irreparable damage to both their current and future career. Unfortunately, this can serve to mute whistleblowers. They are not cowards, merely realists. Having families to feed and bills to pay is a heady consideration. In the U.S., whistleblowers can at least have some confidence that if their information leads to a successful prosecution, they may be rewarded. There is a risk versus reward element to their decision, unlike here in the U.K. Some of the whistleblowing rewards in the United States are, of course, eye watering. In 2021 , the SEC passed the $1 billion dollar threshold for rewards made, including a payment that year exceeding $110 million. I am not advocating that a U.K. system should precisely mirror that in the U.S. — merely that we should be able to formulate more realistic rewards that will justify an individual’s decision to whistle blow, enabling them to make that risk versus reward judgment about the impact on their career. Could rewarding whistleblowers encourage malicious reporting for profit? In my experience and view, such instances are rare, and the outcome is unlikely to result in a prosecution or sanction. Those reading this article will likely be steeped in the regulated systems that form the foundation for AML and anti-corruption efforts. They may also consider themselves, by default, to be a potential target for a malicious whistleblower. I see Money Laundering Reporting Officers (MLROs) as being akin to “deputized” law enforcement officers. Their role may see them called upon to make decisions not unlike those made by police officers. I believe it is the fear of malicious whistleblowing that has been at the heart of the U.K.’s resistance to the U.S. model. However, the recent case involving the Royal Bank of Canada in London should go some way to assuaging these concerns. In this instance, a whistleblower at the bank claimed they had been “managed out” of the organisation because they had passed information to the regulator, alleging constructive dismissal. An employment tribunal, however, found no basis in fact and dismissed the case. Bear in mind that this was merely a constructive dismissal case -- not a hearing that could lead to multi-million-dollar fines or even prosecutions leading to culprits being incarcerated. This result goes to the core of my argument. The fact that the respective thresholds for fines or convictions are set so high means that only those who have committed wrongdoing should be concerned by allegations of this type. Before anyone asserts that this is an easy notion for me to voice (as these possibilities will never apply to me), I should point out that, in the police service, we were all subject to malicious complaints every day of the year. Only those who were guilty lost any sleep. The point I am seeking to make is that incentivizing whistleblowers is only a bad thing if their allegations are unfounded in fact and unsupported by corroborative evidence. In effect, the U.K. needs to accept that some malicious, ill-founded allegations are likely. But nobody has anything to worry about unless they have erred, given the safety measures in place in the form of investigation and evidential thresholds. Unfortunately, the current status quo in the U.K. is more likely to allow the crooked to get away with the frauds and malpractice we all want to see exposed. We should not continue to oppose a system that is designed to help us rid the world of such corrupt individuals. Neither should we continue to reject the notion that whistleblowing deserves rewards simply because someone may occasionally make an unfounded accusation. The whole ethos of the U.K.’s position regarding whistleblowing needs to be reconsidered. Directors and CEOs of organizations operating in the regulated sector need to accept that at some stage they will be subject to a complaint, and that their MLRO should be supported until such time as there is a failure to be addressed—just like the police. Tony McClements is Managing Director of Investigations at Martin Kenney & Co (MKS), and a guest lecturer in Fraud and Financial Investigation at the University of Central Lancashire.

The Certified Fraud Examiner Seeks to Prove Reality,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=the-certified-fraud-examiner-seeks-to-prove-reality,"By: Marlon Balogh, CFE, MS-FA Reality is simply based in fact, whether it be an event or transaction. A fraudster’s movement is a documented reality. Reality, or the truth, is simply confirmed by documentation, digital footprints and verifiable eyewitnesses, which can be pieced together to reveal the factual timeline. This has now become a natural law in a technologically driven society where a person’s movements, swipes, likes, interests and all other relevant personal metadata is collected to identify an individual. Similarly, transactions are digitally documented, as is an entity’s statements, claims and societal influence. Fraudsters are aware of such circumstances and, therefore, attempt to augment the perception of reality and fact surrounding the perpetration of fraud. Simply put, a fraudster will always be actively in the process of concealment. Fortunately for forensic accountants, such a task is prone to errors and holes, leaving behind trails of evidence to piece together. The duty of a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) and those engaged to determine indicia of fraud is to seek out facts that illustrate the reality supported by evidence. This evidence, though, must be enough to bring the fraudster’s augmented reality back to a fact-based timeline of events. What is meant by “fact based timeline” in forensic accounting and fraud examination and how does a CFE determine an appropriate level of evidence to determine the facts? The CFE or engaged professional should consider a timeline, a visual demonstration, as a base for developing the full story for effective understanding of financial events as it is supported by documentation. This approach offers guidance, eliminating false narrative, and instead replacing it with a fact-based, evidence-supported, comparative timeline of events. Obtaining the Right Evidence Concealment is a full-time job for a fraud perpetrator. First-time fraudsters are often worried and anxious whether their scheme will be identified, unless one has sociopathic characteristics. Quite often, the fraudster becomes tired of concealment and, once relaxed, the fraud is discovered by a fellow co-worker, manager or even client. In the matter of kiting schemes, once a perpetrator sets off for a vacation after years of concealing a fraud, suddenly an overlooked and outstanding bill is no longer considered “paid,” toppling the house of cards built over the period of concealment. It is not likely that a fraud can last forever; it’s quite an undertaking to manage on a regular basis. This leaves the fraudster prone to errors and mistakes. Fraudsters are often tech savvy and intelligent people who can augment receipts, documentation, bank statements and checks using simple editing tools that are readily available on office computers, such as Adobe, free open-source software, and Microsoft Paint and Word. This is considerably important when determining what is a reliable source of documentation and evidence. Documents received from the accused should always be compared to a third-party source such as banks, financial institutions, vendors or other related third parties. Determining the appropriate evidence is affected by the type of scheme, size and breadth of the fraud perpetrated. These factors determine the level of detail, work and scope the CFE is required to complete to obtain enough evidentiary details and information. So, what is sufficient to support a fact-based timeline? Sufficient evidence for a CFE is either evidence that thoroughly determines and states fact, or a large enough volume of evidence to ensure that fact can be relied upon, illustrated and explained. A single piece of evidence that is sufficient to determine fact is evidence from an unbiased, uncoerced and reliable third party, which details facts that may confirm a tested detail. To elaborate further, a tested detail is a partial story line or claim tested against provided documentation. For instance, a fraudster may claim that $500 on a specific date was used for a utility expense. When tested, the $500 was not supported by a receipt but was confirmed to be transferred to a personal bank account. Further testing of the personal account also confirmed that no such utility expense was paid for or identified. The CFE must, of course, have a starting point to test claims and, therefore, the CFE determines the nature and environment in which the perpetrator acts. A trained CFE can determine the general documentation required to begin their investigation based on the industry and known procedures, practices and processes. Preliminary knowledge of the industry, during a discovery phase, allows the CFE to request documentation and prompts the attorney to file subpoenas. As documentation arrives, the CFE promptly begins analysis that narrows the facts, taking from the documentation all relevant information with a level of detail that properly supports the analysis and whether there is indicia of fraud or not. For instance, data such as receipts, email chains with vendors, bank statements and cashed checks should all support a narrative that is completed. Simply put, a story must have a beginning, middle and end. Without this natural progression, the story is incomplete. An important detail for a CFE is to visually complete a timeline of events of the fraud perpetrated, supported by the evidence attached directly to the timeline. Such demonstrations allow its users to adequately understand the timeframe in conjunction with evidence, portraying the scheme as it unfolded. This type of demonstration has proven quite effective within the courtroom as it guides the attorneys and displays complex accounting in a palpable, easily understood manner. In a similar light, a CFE may not be able to state that all evidence supports a conclusion of indicia of fraud if there are missing pieces, such as the transactions identified in bank statements, receipts or checks. What could be said is that there is potential of concealment and that additional work is required to complete an analysis to reach a conclusion of indicia of fraud. CFEs face a challenge of limited information, but with enough documentation may conclude on the indicia of fraud and support a complete narrative. A Second Obstacle: Combatting Confirmation Bias CFEs as individuals are not perfect and often face their own internalized challenge of confirmation bias. For instance, once an engagement is presented and base details of the suspected fraud are provided, an inexperienced or compromised CFE may generate a preconception of unsupportable details or draw preliminary conclusions regarding type of fraud, process and concealment methods prior to any review of reliable documentation. This behavior, either based on instinct or a compromising relationship with clients, often leads the CFE to test the evidence in a particularly biased manner (i.e., they may only want to review documentation that supports their opinion of fraud and avoid looking at documentation that may contradict or disprove their notion). CFEs must learn early in their careers to maintain an unbiased approach and in spite of professional relationships with clients. By ignoring documentation that could potentially alter the conclusions of any analysis performed, such work burdens attorneys and especially those accused of wrongdoing. A deeper version of confirmation bias that is not often spoken of, but exists within the industry, is the misapplication of the forensic approach, steps and procedures. For instance, a knowledgeable and seasoned, but biased, CFE may choose to apply a damages-based approach to a fraud matter if it could narrate a different story and prove indicia of fraud (or not) in a case that would require procedures for embezzlement and theft. This application would offset the total amount of monies embezzled or stolen in the favor of the perpetrator. While this is an oversimplification, confirmation bias can not only be evidence based but could also be completed at the engagement level following inappropriate design and procedures on an engagement. An unbiased CFE may also fall victim to improperly applying procedures and considering themselves as creative in technique and approach, not realizing the misapplication of procedures. Such knowledge allows the CFE or expert witness to instead argue the difference of approach in court as it may differ from the opposing forensic expert. CFEs that are opposing biased application of technique and standards should be aware of strategies to also augment the nature of the fraud scheme. The biased CFE is likely to narrate an expert report that lessens or heightens the severity of a scheme depending on which side their bias resides. The Ultimate Timeline Test Returning to the demonstrative timeline, on which we base our understanding of the events that occurred during the suspected perpetration of fraud, allows each CFE to ground themselves in an unbiased reality. Each moment on the timeline should be well documented, supported and completed with attached exhibits and supportable documentation for each event illustrated. Documentation should be tested, corroborated with appropriate parties and only then reported and evidenced within the working analysis. Such thorough processes eliminate the possibility of falsified documentation entering the relied upon support and, instead, ensures that the CFE’s demonstrative accurately records and displays for its users only fact. While the topic evidence is not detailed in its complexity, its gravity on matters regarding fraud examination and forensic accounting ensures that CFEs only report fact and not opinion. The industry only serves to benefit from reliable documentation and therefore so does the judicial system with its use of CFEs.",embezzlement,"For instance, a knowledgeable and seasoned, but biased, CFE may choose to apply a damages-based approach to a fraud matter if it could narrate a different story and prove indicia of fraud (or not) in a case that would require procedures for embezzlement and theft."
Unethical Actions of Russian Energy Companies Are Rattling the Marketplace,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=unethical-actions-of-russian-energy-companies-are-rattling-the-marketplace,"By: Syed Zubair Ahmed, CFE The backbone of the Russian economy is energy exports. The Russian energy sector is an enormous global asset driving economic activity across the world. In 2021, Russian crude and condensate output reached 10.5 million barrels per day, making up 14% of the world’s total supply . In the same year, Russia exported oil worth USD 300 billion, accounting for 11% of the global oil trade.  The country exports most of its oil production, with almost all going to Europe (about 80%) and Asia (about 20%). Russia has the world’s largest proven crude oil reserves, totaling almost 264 billion barrels as of January 2021. The country also has the second largest proven natural gas reserves in the world, totaling about 1,688 trillion cubic feet as of the same date. The country’s oil and gas sector accounts for more than 50% of its GDP and more than 70% of its export. As the world’s largest oil producer, Russia has a major impact on global oil markets. Russian entrepreneurs have found a new and ingenious way to manipulate the Russian economy—through the use of their oil and gas wealth. In particular, they rely on natural gas and oil prices to determine their profit margins, which in turn gives them a lot of power over the country's oligarchs. This practice has led to rampant corruption, including political bribery or setting up front companies, as the energy companies keep enriching themselves at the expense of the Russian people. The abusive practices of the Russian energy sector have caused a public outcry in Europe and America, with some politicians calling for sanctions on Russia, as allegations have been raised throughout both the public and private sectors in the country. The recent, shocking surge in fake Russian oil sales has generated a great deal of confusion and speculation. Some believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to undermine the West by selling oil at a discount, while others suggest that he is stockpiling oil to create an artificial shortage and bolster prices in the event of a global crisis. It is impossible to know for sure what Putin’s motivations are, but it is important to be aware of the danger that these fake sales pose. The reason for this surge in fake Russian oil sales is still unknown, but many experts believe that it is due to the deteriorating situation in Ukraine. The fighting has caused a sharp decrease in the production of crude oil and shale gas, which is the main source of income for Russian energy companies. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, these fake oil sellers are Russian energy companies, which are very keen to steal profits, as they know that the current oil market is currently unstable. These companies are often associated with corrupt officials and, as such, pose a threat to national security. Several major players remain in the Russian oil industry in recent years. Russia's top oil producer is state-owned Rosneft. It is followed by Lukoil, which is the largest privately owned oil company in the country. Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegaz, Tatneft and Russneft also have significant holdings in the Russian oil industry. These five Russian energy companies represent how the nation's oil and gas industry is dominated by state forces. A post-Soviet group of companies, they all operate similarly and are closely intertwined, with one executive today even being accused of stealing more than $5 billion from his firm. According to a report by The Financial Times, Rosneft was manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the global benchmark interest rate in a scheme that may have contributed to the financial crisis of 2007–08. LIBOR is used as a benchmark to set the rates for trillions of dollars worth of loans worldwide, so any manipulation of the rate can have serious consequences for the stability of the global financial system. As it turns out, mostly relying on natural gas and oil prices to determine their profit margins, the manipulation by Russian energy companies has led to wasteful spending on projects that have little to no benefit for the country as a whole. In 2013, Gazprom transferred 1.4 billion rubles (USD 27 million) from its subsidiary, Rusnano, to a company owned by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich. Mikhail Abyzov, a former Russian politician and businessman, was arrested in March 2019 on suspicion of embezzling over USD 69 million from a state-owned company. This high-profile arrest of the once-influential Russian politician and businessman sparked public outcry. The arrest came as a surprise to many, as Abyzov was previously close to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Abyzov is known for two things: He was on Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev’s team, but more importantly, he was the chairman of the board of the state-owned Russian electricity grid holding company. Roman Abramovich could be considered one of the luckiest men in the world. He was born into a family of Jewish immigrants in the Soviet Union and was able to parlay his family's connections into a successful career in the oil industry. Russia’s richest man and owner of the Chelsea Football Club, Abramovich's net worth is USD 8.7 billion, and he has been able to amass this fortune through his company, Lukoil, one of the largest oil companies in the world. Unfortunately, Abramovich has been implicated in oil scams, and it has been revealed that his company needs more money because it used rackets to launder money from the people in the Middle East. Oil companies like Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as aluminum producer Rusal, is subject to political shell games that lead to instability in global markets. This has serious consequences for oil prices and shorter-term commodity prices like copper and aluminum, which was seen recently with a sharp sell-off in those stocks on Wall Street. The reason for this price drop is that Russia's energy companies are dumping their bad news into the market by dumping billions upon billions of dollars worth of shares onto the public markets over the last several months. Most of this came following sanctions imposed on Russia by western governments across Europe (more specifically Germany) after Putin annexed Crimea from Ukraine. It’s the first-time sanctions of this nature have been imposed on Russian companies. They range from bans on defense exports to outright bans on key oil or gas exports such as Novatek. As per speculations made by investors, Russia's oil industry is going to slow down due to the current economic condition and sanctions imposed on its energy companies. To seize control of the oil resource, Russian energy companies continue to cheat the system and enrich the privileged. The years-long lull in global oil prices has done little to deter Russia’s thirst for oil. Instead, it has fueled a renewed focus on “unconventional” sources of crude that are becoming more prevalent in the interior and country's vast wilderness. Over the past decade, Russia has been one of the few nations in the world that haven't been struck by a major oil crisis. But this doesn't mean that Russia isn't worried about oil prices either. Oil has played an important role in Russia's economy and politics for decades, so it's no surprise that when oil prices began to fall rapidly and unexpectedly, the Russian leaders believed that action needed to be taken. The Russian media has been ineffective in helping to uncover the corruption of the Russian government. While it does have a role in spreading propaganda, it is also responsible for disseminating fake news. This is because Russian reporters are often paid to disseminate propaganda rather than report on indisputable facts. This makes it difficult to find accurate information about the Russian government. It appears that the Russian government has a great need for the oil they produce. It's estimated that they are making USD 27 billion from unethical practices. Although many people think these crimes are just perpetrated by low-level workers, professionals are almost certainly involved in the crimes. Russia has been able to maintain a stable supply of energy throughout its territory despite extreme winter conditions and poor infrastructure for one reason: the sheer size of its oil reserves. Other countries are unable to keep up with these large reserves because they lack enough cold weather and natural gas to power their economies. The Russian oil industry and its pipelines carry over 90% of all Russian international energy exports. Russia's oil sector has been under scrutiny by Western governments, which have often accused Russia of covering up its arms or conducting underground trade with Iran. The Russian government has mostly denied these allegations and labeled them as propaganda campaigns that are intended to discredit Russia's foreign policy. The question of whether Russia is going to tighten the control of its economy or strengthen its relations with the West has become a hot topic for many political analysts. With oil prices continuing to decline, the Kremlin has shown signs that it may be more inclined to tighten its control over its economy. However, given Russia’s history of engaging in Eurasianism and its recent achievements in Ukraine, some analysts believe that Russia will instead strengthen its relations with the West.","bribery, scam","This practice has led to rampant corruption, including political bribery or setting up front companies, as the energy companies keep enriching themselves at the expense of the Russian people.

From Their Plates to Our Pockets — $250 Million Stolen from Pandemic Food Program,Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=250-million-dollars-stolen-from-pandemic-food-program,"The Justice Department charged 47 defendants on September 20th for allegedly defrauding a federal program that provided food for needy children during the pandemic, describing the scheme — totaling nearly $250 million — as the largest uncovered to date. The charges also underscore that criminals have been quick to take advantage of new programs set up by the U.S. government to curb fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, and they’re exploiting weaknesses in systems designed to quickly distribute funds. The indictments announced Tuesday involve six groups and one individual, all connected to a Minnesota nonprofit called Feeding Our Future. The defendants are charged with federal crimes including conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering and paying or receiving illegal kickbacks. The DOJ alleges that Aimee Bock, the founder of Feeding Our Future in Apple Valley, Minnesota — which actually did serve federally funded meals to underserved kids before the pandemic struck — masterminded the plot. According to the DOJ, Bock recruited other individuals to create websites falsely claiming they were sponsored by her group. The sites purported that donations would be used to feed needy children — but no such donation receipt records could ever be found when federal agents investigated this allegation. Records show that Feeding Our Future's disbursements grew from approximately $3.4 million in 2019 to nearly $200 million in 2021. “This was a brazen scheme of staggering proportions,” said Andrew M. Luger, U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota. “These defendants exploited a program designed to provide nutritious food to needy children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, they prioritized their own greed, stealing more than a quarter of a billion dollars in federal funds to purchase luxury cars, houses, jewelry, and coastal resort property abroad.” The theft of $250 million from the food program is a serious crime, but it is also just one more example of how fraud and corruption threaten our world's ability to meet the needs of its people.",money laundering,"The defendants are charged with federal crimes including conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering and paying or receiving illegal kickbacks."
Crypto Platform “Head Trader” Pleads Guilty in $100 Million Ponzi Scheme,John Duffley,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=crypto-platform-head-trader-pleads-guilty-in-100-million-ponzi-scheme,"The head trader of EmpiresX, a global cryptocurrency platform headquartered in Florida, pleaded guilty on September 8 in an alleged investment fraud that raised around $100 million for the company, according to the U.S. Justice Department . Joshua David Nicholas, 28, admitted to the securities fraud in which he and others at EmpiresX falsely claimed their business’ trading bot, which utilized artificial and human intelligence, mitigated risk and increased the chances of profitability on an investment. In reality, the approximately $100 million received from investors was paid out to the company’s earliest investors in a Ponzi scheme. Additionally, EmpiresX never registered, nor made any attempt to register, as a legitimate investment program with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). EmpiresX co-founders Emerson Sousa Pires and Flavio Mendes Gonçalves were indicted by the Justice Department alongside Nicholas back in June on conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud charges; the co-founders faced charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering as well. The SEC filed charges the same day against the company and trio, alleging the men misled investors with false claims of a 1% daily profit when using their technology, as well as misappropriating investor funds for personal use. Pires and Gonçalves also allegedly prevented investors from withdrawing any funds before fleeing to their home country of Brazil, according to the SEC . Nicholas faces up to five years in prison on one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. EmpiresX first formed in 2017 before “officially” launching in 2020, according to an introductory webinar on the company's website, which is no longer available. Defining its core values as innovation, transparency and tranquility, the fraudulent organization claimed to “devise strategies that even with the market down, we have an exponential profit.” On the contrary, the company’s Earnings & Income Disclaimer cites at least four times there is “no assurance” investors will do well.

20 Years After Sarbanes-Oxley,"Laura Harris,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=sarbanes-oxley-act-of-2002,"Sarbanes-Oxley, my how you’ve grown. It is hard to believe that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 turned 20 years old in July. While some of us feel like we are in 2019 or 2020, still trying to process the way the world has been influenced by the pandemic, surely SOX wasn’t TWENTY YEARS AGO?! Yet, here we are. Arthur Andersen, Enron and WorldCom certainly left behind a legacy that changed the financial world, especially that of the public company. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was born thanks to SOX and with it brought attention and improvements to: Auditing Standards Auditing inspections, investigations and enforcement Auditor independence Accounting standards Corporate governance and accountability Financial transparency Foreign companies Fraud prevention Whistleblower protections SOX continues to evolve and help assure investors and the general public of the good faith they can place in public companies. However, as fraudsters continue to develop their own tactics, laws, measures and internal controls must always continue developing.  One piece of SOX demonstrates that it is not just words on a page, but it has a deep breadth of influence and interpretability. Section 304 of Sarbanes-Oxley While many companies face various charges from the SEC, one of the less commonly used parts of the SOX Act includes Section 304(a) (commonly referred to as SOX 304), a provision that permits the SEC to order the disgorgement of bonuses and incentive or equity-based compensation earned by the CEO and CFO in the 12 months following the issuance of any financial statement that the issuer is required to restate because of misconduct, and the reimbursement of those funds to the issuer. However, in 2009, while the SEC issued a settled enforcement action against CSK Auto Corp. that alleged CSK improperly accounted for vendor allowances and consequently overstated income in 2002, 2003 and 2004, the SEC also first filed to use the provision to clawback compensation in a civil suit from CSK’s former CEO who was not accused of violating any securities law. The district court sided with the SEC, concluding that SOX 304 does not contain a personal liability requirement and that it is the issuer’s misconduct that initiates the clawback provision — that is, CEOs and CFOs do not need to have personally engaged in the misconduct requiring accounting restatements to be liable for the clawback of bonuses and other incentive-based compensation under SOX 304. The court observed that disgorgement under the provision “is merited to prevent corporate officers from profiting from the proceeds of misconduct, whether it is their own misconduct or the misconduct of the companies they are paid to run.” In 2016, the SEC declined to pursue reimbursement from the CEO and former CFO of Monsanto after the executives returned cash bonuses and stock awards received during the period of accusations. Additionally in 2016, while charging biopesticide company Marrone Bio Innovations with accounting fraud, and reaching a settlement, the SEC did not charge the company’s executives with any charges related to misconduct. Under Section 304(b), the SEC is permitted to exempt any person as it deems necessary and appropriate. However, the SEC has not provided any meaningful guidance regarding the factors for such an exemption. As seen with Marrone Bio and Monsnato, the actions suggest that the SEC’s expectation of reimbursement of some forms of compensation, a willingness to forego an enforcement action if reimbursement is made, and a willingness to pursue an enforcement action to compel what the SEC considers appropriate or required reimbursement. In 2021, the SEC charged the former CEO and CFO of WageWorks Inc. with making false and misleading statements and omissions — including to the company’s auditors — which resulted in the company’s improper recognition of revenue related to a contract with a large public-sector client. The SEC then invoked the rarely used SOX 304 to obtain reimbursement of incentive-based compensation earned by the executives. The SEC said that executives should not profit from their, or their company's, misconduct. In 2022, the SEC charged Synchronoss with accounting fraud and ordered it to pay $12.5 million in penalties. Again, the former CEO was not charged in connection with the company’s fraud but was still required to reimburse the company for over $1.3 million in stock sale profits and bonuses. Again, this demonstrated the SEC’s ability to charge all those responsible for the fraud and include the CEO, though not culpable, for being in an accountable position to prevent the fraud through implementation of stronger internal controls. SOX 304 remains a useful, discretionary provision for the SEC. Twenty years from now, we will likely see more changes and interesting applications of all SOX provisions as fraudsters greedily continue to scam, scheme, bamboozle and hustle their way through corporations.",scam,"Twenty years from now, we will likely see more changes and interesting applications of all SOX provisions as fraudsters greedily continue to scam, scheme, bamboozle and hustle their way through corporations."
The Oversight Role of Supreme Audit Institutions,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=oversight-role-of-supreme-audit-institutions,"By: Fuimaono Afele, CFE, Ahsiu Lin, CFE, Norris Mitchell, CFE, and Nafanua Tualatamalelagi, CFE, from the Samoa Audit Office. Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) play an important role in national and global economy by ensuring that public resources are managed properly and in accordance with established rules. They normally produce an audit opinion, which may give opinions about whether the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the reporting framework. Some SAIs, in addition to performing post-auditing responsibilities, also carry out controller functions of the national treasury--the controller function is a pre-audit function, meaning it is done before the fact. Under the constitutions of some countries, no money can be issued out of the national treasury except in pursuant of a warrant of payment. In addition to this, it is required under the public finance management legislations that, before any such warrant is approved, it should be certified first by the SAI whether the amount thereof may be lawfully issued. Warrants of payments are usually issued based on the appropriations that are approved by the Legislative Assembly, although there are emergency exceptions permitted under the laws of some countries. Even after appropriations are approved by the Legislative Assembly, the finance legislations still require the SAI to pre-audit all payments from the national treasury. Post-audit functions make up most of the audit functions of SAIs. The first post-audit function focuses on the core government, consisting of ministries and offices of the constitution and parliament, which delivers pure public goods and services.t. In some countries, the core government has a centralized accounting system, so its financial statements are consolidated into a whole of government public accounts. The SAIs in such jurisdictions conduct audits of the individual entities as well as the whole of government financial statements or public accounts. The second post-audit function of SAIs relates to the public enterprises of the government. These entities are usually established as business or commercial units delivering commercial goods and services. The pre-audits and post-audits discussed above are grouped together as the financial audits of the SAIs. SAIs in recent years, however, have developed operational audit capacity and capability. Under those operational audit mandates, SAIs usually establish: Performance and environmental audit function or unit. Compliance audit function or unit. Information and communication technologies audit function or unit. A special audit function or unit conducting the audit of fraud, abuse waste and corruption. SAIs also provides support services units such as strategic, personnel and corporate services, information and communications technologies, and infrastructure units. Furthermore, SAIs has communications and stakeholder relationships units. While some people consider a communication and relationship unit a support service unit, I think otherwise and consider communication and relationships to be a core function of SAIs. It is essential for SAIs to communicate the results of their audit work to stakeholders so that it is immediately relevant and helps improve national governance and quality of life. Reporting to parliament has always been the end result of the audit work of SAIs. The preparation and submission of reports by the communications and stakeholder relationships unit to parliament is usually followed by a robust debate, both within and outside parliament, and provides scrutiny on the national governance and financial and performance accountability of those in charge Once the reports are submitted and the parliamentary process is completed, the reports become available on  SAI and parliament websites to keep  stakeholders and any other interested parties informed.  Reports to parliament are only one of the communication channels SAIs use to convey their message, spread news about good and ethical governance, and raise financial and performance accountability required of those in charge of governance. SAIs may also communicate their findings through blogs, newsletters, bulletins, social media etc. Integrity Work in Recent Years The integrity work of SAIs can use the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) as guidelines and standards for its planning, fieldwork and reporting. UNCAC, however, does not appear to cover corruption and bribery in the election of members of parliament. I am of the view that UNCAC should address corruption and integrity violations and breaches in all components of the national integrity system, especially the election of members of parliament. Blessings and good fortunes of a country flow from the top, starting with its leaders and down to its citizens. Auditors believe that the tone at the top of an organization sets the direction of what follows below. Therefore, it is important for UNCAC and all national and international integrity initiatives to consider elections as the most important pillar to focus on within the national integrity system.  The SAIs provide oversight in various ways, such as: Through the controller function over the national treasury. As the constitutional auditor of the state or public sector, inclusive of the legislature, executive and judiciary. As the constitutional auditor for the people, citizens and taxpayers. As an independent advisor to the executive government on its national governance, financial and performance accountability. As an advocate for good and ethical governance, accountability, transparency and integrity through its communications, education and awareness activities. As a reporter for the people, citizens and taxpayers who are directly affected by the national governance, as well as the financial and performance accountability of the public sector.",bribery,"UNCAC, however, does not appear to cover corruption and bribery in the election of members of parliament."
"Mentoring Success Story: Kate Rolan and David Harper, CFE",Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=mentoring-success-story-kate-rolan-david-harper-cfe,"The ACFE Mentoring Program connects members to anti-fraud professionals from all over the world who can offer a wealth of resources, experience, advice and guidance. Mentees can search among registered mentors to find individuals whose experience and expertise match the areas in which they wish to be mentored. Kate Rolan initially reached out to David Harper, CFE, after seeing his experience in law enforcement and investigations on the ACFE Community . This is Kate and David’s mentoring story. How did you become interested in fraud and what is your current role? Kate : I am currently employed as an Internal Revenue Agent for Tax Exempt and Government Entities, IRS. I got interested in fraud about three years ago when I started working on a case showing some fraud indicators. The audit was complicated but very interesting. I decided to learn more about fraud, talked to my colleagues, found out about ACFE, and joined! David : I became interested in fighting against fraud early in my federal law enforcement career when I was assigned to the New York City office of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. I had previously worked in general crimes, including homicides, sexual assaults and property crimes. I had an opportunity to become involved in complex financial crimes and fraud against the government. I found these types of cases were more challenging and captured my attention. After retiring from federal law enforcement in 2016, I successfully sought an opportunity as the Inspector General for the City of Albuquerque, where I worked for a few years before accepting an opportunity as the Inspector General for the Florida Department of Financial Services. Why was it important for both of you to join the Mentoring Program? Kate : I was looking for a mentor who was experienced in fraud investigation and could provide guidance for real-life tough audits and give some tips for case development. I wanted to learn more about the ACFE and expand my network contacts. Another goal was to prepare for the CFE exam and get advice from a person who had already done it. David : I’ve had many informal mentors during my career from whom I gained so much knowledge.  I have long believed it was important to give back by sharing my knowledge and experience with others. It is a great way to pay it forward. Kate, what inspired you to request David? Kate : I thought that it was a great opportunity to learn from a professional. I was looking for real-life experience, willingness to teach, and a positive attitude. David is very compassionate about mentoring and went out of his way to help me to grow professionally in a new field for me. David, how did you know Kate would be the right mentee for your experience and skillset? David : After receiving a request from Kate to be her mentor, we had an opportunity to talk and spoke about what she was seeking. Since my background is in law enforcement and investigations, rather than accounting and auditing, I wanted to be sure that I was the right person to help her. I told her that I could help in the investigations area, and it turned out that was what she was seeking. What advice do you both have for anyone who wants to join the ACFE Mentoring Program? Kate : I know it's not always easy to find a mentor. I would recommend starting to search for potential mentors earlier, before the program officially starts and send requests to several mentors. Then have a discovery call with all potential mentors who responded to your requests. During your conversation ask questions, explain your expectations for the mentoring program and listen to your interlocutor, thus you will be able to find a mentor who best meets your expectations. You will have a very rewarding learning experience, meet a new colleague and expand your expertise. David : I believe the ACFE Mentoring program provides great potential for learning and networking. It’s not just the mentee learning from the mentor, but an exchange of experiences, ideas and advice—a win-win opportunity! What challenges did you face during your session? How did you handle adversity to still have a productive mentoring session? David : Unfortunately, I was diagnosed with severe COVID and was hospitalized followed by 24-hour oxygen treatment for a few months after my hospitalization. Because I wasn’t able to actively mentor Kate during this time, I told her that I would continue to mentor her for a few more months afterwards. Kate : I don't think we had many challenges. David had created a plan for our sessions and every meeting we discussed a new topic, I asked questions. During our collaboration with David, I have learned a lot of new information about fraud investigation process and other issues. He was always on time and followed his promises to provide the materials or cover new interesting topics. What has been the most rewarding part of your journey together? Kate : I am very grateful to David for his very warm, friendly attitude and his desire to teach and share his knowledge of fraud examination with a newbie. David was my first ACFE mentor and after having such a positive experience with him, I decided to continue participating in the ACFE Mentoring program. I understood the fraud investigation process as a whole and realized I want to continue to learn and become a fraud investigator myself. I definitely feel more prepared for the exam and I'm going to study harder and take it this year. David : I believe our mentoring relationship provided both of us with an opportunity to learn about new things that will help each of us in our fight against fraud. For me, Kate’s experience as a revenue agent for the Internal Revenue Service, allowed me to learn more about the mission of IRS and how they detect and investigate tax fraud.

Take Pride in Fighting Fraud: How the LGBTQ Community Can Stay Vigilant All Year Long,Emma Richardson,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=how-the-lgbtq-community-can-stay-vigilant-all-year-long,"Pride Month may be over, but, for scammers, the calendar doesn’t matter: there’s fraud to be had every month of the year. It’s more important than ever for the LGBTQ+ community to maintain its collective strength – especially when it comes to the scams that target them. Here are some of the most common fraud schemes perpetrated against members of the LGBTQ+ community, along with some useful tips on how to identify, deter and successfully circumvent these fraud attempts. Romance Fraud As the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) points out in its post about fraud during Pride Month, many of the tools and resources cultivated by the LGBTQ+ community can be easily weaponized by fraudsters. It’s a very dirty trick, given that many in the community report struggling with isolation and loneliness, and therefore rely on outlets like dating and neighborhood apps to feel more connected to those around them. While the FTC states romance scams cost victims an estimated $304 million in 2020 , it may be impossible to know exactly what percentage of those victims were LGBTQ+ members, as the FTC does not delineate fraud victims by sexual orientation or gender identity. One aspect of romance fraud in the LGBTQ+ community that differentiates it from romance fraud committed against heterosexual targets is that these scams are more likely be extortive in nature than emotionally manipulative or compelling. Romance fraudsters preying upon LGBTQ+ victims frequently convince their intended targets to send compromising photos or messages, then threaten to release these items publicly or send them to friends and family of the victim unless the victim pays them. Compare this to romance scams where the fraudster implores the victim with some kind of “sob story”. For example, a medical or financial emergency has arisen and fast cash is needed. Of course, these types of manipulative scams can also target LGBTQ+ members. However, extortion scams stick out as an especially low form of fraud amongst victims who have historically been forced to keep their identities closeted. To avoid being the victim of a romance scam, the FTC recommends never sending money to anyone that you have not met in person. It’s also a good idea to do a reverse Google image search on the profile picture of any individuals you connect with on an app. You may be surprised what you find. If someone is actively extorting you, or has in the past, you can report itto the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative by calling the crisis hotline at 844-878-CCRI (2274). Affinity Fraud LGBTQ+ people are also at risk for affinity fraud schemes, as these frauds target the demographic members of a specific identity or community. To win over trust from victims, fraudsters often pose as members of the demographic in question and, after building relationships, can rope victims into Ponzi schemes or other common investment scams. Perhaps the most well-known example of an affinity fraud scheme targeting the LGBTQ+ community occurred in 2012, when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in southern Florida against a 67-year-old man who was accused of defrauding investors out of as much as $11 million – many of whom were well-known members of the local gay community. Potential victims of affinity frauds can keep themselves protected by taking extra precautions around proposed investment opportunities. The SEC recommends researching the background of any individual soliciting an investment – as well as never making an investment based exclusively on the endorsement of a community or organization member to which the potential victim may belong. Charity Fraud In our high-octane political atmosphere, solicitations for charitable donations are more ubiquitous than ever. Therefore, it’s incumbent upon well-meaning donors to be on the lookout for suspicious contribution requests or charities that don’t seem quite on the up-and-up. While alerts sent out by legitimate organizations can help shed light onto scams already in progress, members of the LGBTQ+ community must still remain as wary as anyone of email or text solicitations for money or personal data. As always, the FTC recommends doing your research before hitting the “donate” button. If you receive an email or text message from an organization make sure to first look them up independently and confirm the organization’s legitimacy. Specifically, a best practice for researching charitable organizations is to type the name of the organization into Google and add the words “scam” or “complaint” to your search. Another potential red flag is when organizations ask for donations to be sent as cryptocurrency. While a cryptocurrency transaction is not itself an indicator of fraud, contributors may want to think twice before initiating one to an unverified organization. Organizations that solicit payment in any currency with potentially untraceable origins (cash, a prepaid gift card, wiring money, etc.) should be looked at twice. Elder Fraud With the population of LGBTQ+ members who are aged 50 or older expected to increase to 5 million individuals by 2030, it’s perhaps no surprise that this demographic is especially vulnerable to scams targeting senior citizens. What’s more, older LGBTQ+ community members are statistically more likely to be estranged from their biological families and less likely than their heterosexual peers to have children; thus, rendering them prime targets for scams that prey upon the elderly or people living on fixed incomes. To help fight back, the organization SAGE , which provides advocacy and resources for aging LGBTQ+ community members, has developed an app called “ SageCents .” The app assists its users with increasing financial literary and personalized financial health to help them avoid becoming open to the types of scams that are easily pinpointed on the vulnerable and desperate. It also exposes users to information on recent fraud schemes and empowers them with reporting tools and support outlets, in case they’ve already been victimized.",scam,"Pride Month may be over, but, for scammers, the calendar doesn’t matter: there’s fraud to be had every month of the year.

Support Groups for Fraud Victims,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=support-groups-for-fraud-victims,"By: Ryan Gregory, CFE As investigators, we have all reached the point in the span of our interviews of what can be said or suggested next in support of fraud victims. With all the busy work of report writing, speaking to law enforcement, preparing for court and filing examination findings, we do not always remember the trauma a financial loss can be to the victim.  As trained as we are, we may not have experienced fraud in our own lives to understand the emotional impact it can have. To say fraud is pervasive would be an understatement. According to the Federal Trade Commission , in 2021, losses related to romance scams were valued at $547 million dollars, more than six times the reported losses in 2017. The FBI reports that business email compromise (BEC) saw a 65% increase of both actual and attempted loss between July 2019 and December 2021 as fraudsters continued to target both large and small businesses through compromised email accounts. The FBI’s 2021 Elder Fraud Report states, “the number of elderly victims has risen at an alarming rate,” and victims over the age of 60 reported losses of $1.7 billion. There is a victim behind each of these numbers: some were able to recover funds, others may have seen arrests and then there are the unfortunate victims who lost it all. An article worth re-reading is the ACFE’s January/February 2019 Fraud Magazine entitled, “Who’s More Susceptible to Fraud?” by Donn LeVie Jr., CFE. It covers the psychology of the fraud attack and the psychological damage a victim may feel. LeVie offers the following statement towards the end of the article: “Victims often carry scars that transcend the loss of funds. Fraudsters can permanently bruise vulnerable souls with their deception and deceit.” Romance fraud victim Jeanne Aikens shares her story in the New Hampshire Business Review . It’s a story of money gone, a scammer that wasn’t caught and the shame felt in being misled. This article also discusses the misconceptions surrounding romance fraud, how it is targeting all age groups and how difficult prosecution is. In the end, Jeanne tells us she has found love and gotten married but still carries emotional bruises from this ordeal. As an investigator who speaks to victims on a weekly basis, I wanted to bring attention to the following groups in the hope that victims can get help or support. Fight Cybercrime This site offers a peer support program for victims of romance scams. Those who are interested can sign up or refer someone for a 10-week virtual program that includes a counselor. AARP Fraud Watch Network VOA | ReST Program AARP Fraud Watch Network and Volunteer of America (VOA) have created a program that offers scam/fraud victims emotional support that includes peer discussion groups. National Identity Theft Victim Assistance Network A network of coalitions across the country that deliver identity theft and cyber-crime victim assistance training. Training is provided to coalition members on how to provide direct victim assistance services. As my wife Dr. Neera Malhotra (Professor with Portland State University) reminds me, the accompaniment of others helps in understanding, accepting and releasing trauma.",scam,"According to the Federal Trade Commission , in 2021, losses related to romance scams were valued at $547 million dollars, more than six times the reported losses in 2017.

Zelle Scams Are on The Rise: A Look at a Recent Attempt,"Kate Pospisil,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=zelle-scams-are-on-the-rise-a-look-at-a-recent-attempt,"It is common these days to sell items we no longer need on online marketplaces such as Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace. It’s easy, local and usually fast. The process is further simplified through the use of peer-to-peer (P2P) payment methods such as Venmo, PayPal and Zelle. However, this ease to buy and sell can attract fraudsters looking to make a quick buck. I personally use Facebook Marketplace frequently and when I recently sold my treadmill, I experienced a scam attempt firsthand. First-hand look at the red flags Now, I am no stranger to scam attempts, and I design my posts to prevent this as much as I can: I clarify Venmo or cash only (with a Venmo hold), I only provide my address after the payment or hold is sent, I don’t generally share my phone number etc. I listed my treadmill on Facebook Marketplace and within one minute, I had a message regarding the post; it was through Facebook Messenger, but from an Instagram account. This man wanted to pay in full immediately and pick up the next day, but he wanted to pay with Zelle. I refused and said Venmo only, but I eventually relaxed a bit figuring it was not much different — in some ways it might even better since money sent via Zelle goes directly into a bank account, whereas Venmo and PayPal go into their own accounts. After all, he was sending the full amount with no questions or counteroffers. I gave him the number attached to my Zelle account; however, he then requested my email address, saying it’s easier to find the account that way. I’m not terribly familiar with Zelle, so I gave him my email address and told him I’d need a minute to make sure it’s attached to the account. Before even confirming the email with Zelle, I received an email… from Zelle. At this point, I realized this was a scam attempt and all the prior red flags were much more obvious. I told the fraudster that it felt suspicious and that I would be calling my bank. He hurried to assure me that “this happens to him all the time,” it’s “because [I] don’t have a business account.” He said repeatedly that he would just transfer me the additional $400, then I could send it back and the hold would release on the original transfer. However, Zelle allows personal accounts to send and receive up to $2,000 a day, so that clearly was not the issue here, meaning I would end up transferring $400 and receiving nothing. I thanked him for giving me the basis for my next fraud blog and blocked him, then rushed to check my bank account and make sure it was unscathed. After confirming all was well on my end, I reported him and began mentally outlining this blog. This fake/false payment scam is only one of the frauds perpetuated through Zelle. In fact, Zelle is being questioned by senators regarding how it responds to its many cases of fraud. Even though Zelle is owned and operated by banks, banks are claiming no responsibility when it comes to fraud committed using their app. Another common scam is when a fraudster pretends to be the bank and contacts the victim to alert them about a fraudulent transaction. The fraudster then scams the victim by encouraging them to “return” the money to themselves using Zelle, but the fraudster has already intercepted their bank account. Because the victim is initiating and approving the fraudulent transfer, the bank declares it not fraudulent, leaving the victim out of money and options. Many victims of this scheme have only been reimbursed after going to the media with their stories. Protecting yourself as a user Online payments through apps such as Zelle are easy to use and serve a valid purpose in today’s digital society. However, as easy as they are to use, they also give fraudsters an easily accessible path to steal your money. The following are some basic tips to help keep you safe, but always remember to remain vigilant. Never transfer money to someone you would not hand a $100 bill to — once you send the money, it is gone, and there is very little you can do to get it back in the case of fraud. Know the requirements and stipulations for the system through which you are transferring funds. Be suspicious about text messages from your bank — do not click links, open attachments or enter personal account information. If you receive a phone call from your bank regarding an online transaction or P2P payment, end it and call the number on the back of your bank card. Report any scam attempts to Zelle.",scam,"I personally use Facebook Marketplace frequently and when I recently sold my treadmill, I experienced a scam attempt firsthand.

Scammers in the Spotlight,"Laura Harris,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=scammers-in-the-spotlight,"Grab the popcorn, uncork the wine and settle in for a wild ride. Fraudsters and their schemes are having quite a moment in pop culture. We have compiled a list of the most popular recent limited series, documentaries and films about fraud that can add context to known cases, illustrate some common fraud schemes and provide insight into the fraudsters at the center of these now infamous frauds. Keep in mind, some of these shows may have taken a few liberties with the details of the cases for entertainment purposes. Fruitcake Fraud (Discovery+) The year is 1896 — deep in the heart of Texas, in a little town called Corsicana, on a little street called Collin, a bakery was born. Famous for fruitcake, Collin Street Bakery became known worldwide, garnering royal and celebrity clientele.  More than a hundred years later in 2013, a nondescript bookkeeper named Sandy Jenkins was discovered to have embezzled nearly $17 million over a decade. Scheme : Starting in 2004, Jenkins wrote company checks to his personal creditors. Over eight years, he misappropriated 888 checks totaling $16.6 million. Jenkins was charged with 10 counts of mail fraud and three counts of money laundering. His wife, who aided in the embezzlement, was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, six counts of money laundering, aiding and abetting, and two counts of making a false statement to a financial institution. Bad Vegan: Fame. Fraud. Fugitive. ( where to watch ) Take equal parts theft, fake identities and gourmet cooking and mix thoroughly with a ridiculous splash of immortality claims to bake this vegan romance fraud. Chris Smith, producer of the popular documentaries “Tiger King” and “Fyre,” interviews many involved in the story of Sarma Melngailis in this four-part docuseries. Scheme : Melngailis wired over $1.6 million from her business — meant for employee wages, investor debt and taxes — to her husband, Anthony Strangis, who was committing fraud under the name Shane Fox. A 24-count indictment charged the couple with grand larceny, criminal tax fraud, scheme to defraud and violation of labor law and related counts. The Dropout ( where to watch ) Amanda Seyfried stars as convicted fraudster Elizabeth Holmes, the deep-voiced, black-turtlenecked founder of Theranos, in this eight-part Hulu Original miniseries, based on the podcast of the same name. Holmes set out to change the health care industry with her biotech startup, once valued at more than $10 billion, but half-truths caught up with her, and Theranos’ star-studded board of directors could no longer obscure the facts. Scheme : Holmes was charged with 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. One conspiracy count addressed defrauding investors while the other addressed allegations of defrauding patients of the Theranos service. The 10 counts of wire fraud addressed similar allegations. Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, former Theranos president and COO, and Holmes’ ex-boyfriend, faces similar charges. Inventing Anna ( where to watch ) “This whole story is completely true ...

Simon Leviev, as he is legally known, has faced and continues to face multiple charges in countries throughout Europe for his schemes. However, according to experts , his “swindling is an international issue — not a national problem, which is easier to prosecute.” Have You Seen This Man? Season 2 ( where to watch ) From podcast to documentary, the outlandish story of John Ruffo’s $350 million bank fraud is yet to reach a conclusion. In this series, ABC News Investigates partners with the U.S. Marshals to crowdsource the capture of this top-15 most wanted fugitive. With a 150-count indictment hanging over him for bank fraud, money laundering, wire fraud and conspiracy, and bail set at $10 million, Ruffo was found guilty. In 1998 as he was set to surrender for a 17-year prison sentence in New York, he turned in his ankle monitor and casually fled the state — and possibly the country. The strange tale of Ruffo begs the question: Have you seen this man? Scheme : With help from a former Philip Morris executive Edward Reiners, Ruffo pitched ""Project Star"" — a bogus project for Philip Morris’s smokeless cigarettes — to banks for financing. Ruffo's computer company, CCS, would provide the hardware and consulting for five offices. Forged documents were also discovered in due diligence research. Strict confidentially agreements stipulated that Reiners, not Phillip Morris, was to be contacted in any communication.

"The Golden Era of Fraud Investigations Is Upon Us, But It Relies on Better Financial eDiscovery",Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=the-golden-era-of-fraud-investigations-is-upon-us-but-it-relies-on-better-financial-ediscovery,"By: Tod McDonald, CPA and Garth Leonard, CFE Recent reports show that PPP loan fraud soared in the last two years, putting billions of taxpayer dollars in the pockets of fraudsters and criminals. The Justice Department now faces an unprecedented number of cases to investigate and experts suggest it will be difficult, if not impossible, to build cases and convict all of those responsible. The merits of speeding aid versus having required additional guardrails can be debated endlessly but regardless, one thing stands out about these fraud cases: it’s challenging to “follow the money,” and the burden on teams having to investigate is exceptionally high. How can we better assess which fraud cases warrant further investigation and find suspect financial relationships and data? How can we improve on what CFEs and partners look at as a dataset? Most importantly — why are we still relegated to manual transcription, legacy optical character recognition (OCR) software and eDiscovery tools, which only evaluate included email systems, mobile devices and file shares, or open-source intelligence from social media sites and forums? Manual transcription and legacy OCR software shortcomings are evident. eDiscovery solutions, while adept at uncovering key relationships and activities, don’t specifically look at bank or brokerage statements, check images or data direct from financial institutions. This makes fraudulent or suspect financial movements difficult to identify. They don’t truly “follow the money” but rather point to potential financial connections that then require further investigation and valuable staff time. Bank and brokerage statements and monetary transfers, arguably the most significant pieces of information to uncover financial fraud, are simply not included or evaluated in the vast majority of today’s eDiscovery and audit tools. These lessons were front and center for Tod, as he worked as the lead investigator in Washington’s largest Ponzi scheme — ultimately unraveling a $150 million complex case with a myriad of actors and financial accounts. Creating financial eDiscovery, not just eDiscovery, is key to not only ensuring accuracy in our investigations but to speeding up the time involved and in identifying where we need to focus versus where we do not. Creating financial datasets — and using today’s more modern technologies to assess and analyze the flow of funds — saves critical staff-time, removes the more menial pieces of an investigation and allows lead investigators and CFEs to use their time judiciously. We will be faced with an unprecedented era and an overwhelming number of fraud cases in the decade ahead. In periods of inexpensive capital and consistent economic expansion, high risk and even fraudulent activities can be masked or even rewarded. But we are starting to see a macroeconomic change; as the money supply becomes more constrained and the cost of capital increases, liquidity and the ability to access funds will become restricted. In other words, the tide is going out and we’ll all get to see who is wearing a swimsuit and who isn’t. This new macro-environment is bound to expose weak business models, high-risk investments, fraud and Ponzi schemes. There is an abundance of financial fraud cases in our future; we see it in the number of PPP loan fraud cases showing up, and we will see it even more as the economy shifts. This represents the opportunity of a lifetime for CFEs. Those that embrace new concepts, like financial eDiscovery, will thrive, while those relying on manual procedures and legacy OCR software will fall behind. The reality is that we are all well-served by bringing more rigor and ease to fraud investigations and fronting them with the tools that truly follow the money. Judging by both the news and the impending restriction of the economic cycle, there is going to be lots of money to follow in the decade ahead.",fraud investigation,The reality is that we are all well-served by bringing more rigor and ease to fraud investigations and fronting them with the tools that truly follow the money.
"Member Spotlight: Paul McCormack, CFE",ACFE Staff,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=member-spotlight-paul-mccormack-cfe,"Paul McCormack, CFE, began his career in anti-fraud as a forensic accountant and after gaining a wealth of experience, he made the leap and started his own freelance writing business in the fraud and compliance space . Paul has written for countless publications and companies throughout the industry, including Fraud Magazine . How did you become passionate about fighting fraud? My career as an anti-fraud professional happened by accident. In my first job as a forensic accountant, I traveled a great deal and became interested in the airline industry. When I contacted a headhunter who worked with Delta, the only role she had available was a project manager in charge of fraud investigations. Initially, I turned down the chance to interview for the role as the fraud cases I had worked on as a forensic accountant weren’t that challenging. Twenty-four hours later, I changed my mind. While the fraud cases I had worked on weren’t as demanding, I’d only been exposed to a handful of cases. It dawned on me that there was much I had to learn, so I took the opportunity. I interviewed and joined Delta as a project manager and was later promoted to the manager of Delta’s Revenue Protection Unit, with responsibility for passenger, agency and employee investigations worldwide. How did you make the switch from being in the industry to creating content? Making the switch to creating content was another accident. While studying for an MBA, I received compliments from professors on written assignments. After graduating, I decided to see if I could freelance on the side and develop my writing skills. I signed up for a freelance writing newsletter and read a help-wanted ad for writers with knowledge of economics, accounting and the law. I applied and started receiving writing assignments immediately. For years, I continued to write on the side, picking up new clients through word of mouth. In 2014, I was between companies and decided to take a leap and focus on writing full time. Within weeks I had a steady client base. Today, my business is thriving. I work with clients around the globe to develop fraud, security and compliance-related content. It’s demanding work, yet it is incredibly gratifying to see my work in print — although most of the time I serve as a ghostwriter. What are some challenges of writing about fraud? Anyone who fights fraud for a living knows how quickly the landscape changes. Similar to fighting fraud, writing about fraud means I must stay up to date on the latest tools and tactics. For me, that’s the biggest challenge. I’m often asked to immerse myself in a complex topic and then develop content to help others understand the nuances of a new fraud scheme or innovative technology designed to prevent it. That requires reading countless articles, white papers, blog posts and interviewing subject matter experts. With that said, I enjoy a challenge and writing about fraud or any of the areas I cover is rarely dull. What is an important lesson you’ve learned in your career? Don’t be too quick to judge. This lesson is applicable when evaluating potential career changes, fraud suspects or any other circumstance which involves a degree of uncertainty. If possible, give yourself the gift of time to assess a situation fully. And if you make a mistake, don’t be afraid to admit it and reverse course. What is important to you about being a CFE? Earning the CFE designation opened my eyes to fraud. The breadth and depth of subjects covered in the CFE exam gave me a solid foundation to build my career as an anti-fraud professional, then launch my writing career many years later. While I’ve lost count of the fraud investigations I’ve conducted and managed, articles I’ve written and presentations I’ve delivered, this is still much I don’t know. Maintaining my certification, reading Fraud Magazine and writing for the ACFE provide constant reminders that fraud is constantly evolving. To stay relevant and serve my clients, I must commit myself to the lifelong learning that the ACFE provides.",fraud investigation,"When I contacted a headhunter who worked with Delta, the only role she had available was a project manager in charge of fraud investigations.

Is This Recruiter a Scammer? Red Flags to Look Out for During the Great Resignation,Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=is-this-recruiter-a-scammer-red-flags,"In the past year, record numbers of employees have been quitting their jobs, and sometimes leaving entire industries. With so much turmoil in the job market, it comes as no surprise that fraudsters are pouncing. Career scammers are targeting job seekers using LinkedIn to reach out with fake offers and requesting personal information. The message may look like it’s coming from a legitimate company — but its origin is much more sinister. These scammers are attempting to steal your information and money. The fraudsters are using the same tactics as other phishing scams, but this time it's disguised as a job offer. The messages may come from fake profiles with few connections or look similar to real company accounts. The job offers sometimes include details about the company that appear legitimate, like saying you were referred by a friend who used to work for the company. While it may appear that there are a plethora of opportunities around every corner, it’s important to stay vigilant in the hunt for new employment and sort the “good” from the “too good to be true.” Here are some red flags to look out for: Bare-bones recruiter profiles Review the recruiter’s profile. If you get a message from a recruiter who has few or no friends in common with you, or whose profile picture looks generic and doesn’t have any other images of them (or their face is obscured), this can be a sign that the account is affiliated with a recruiting scam. Also look out for free-use emails like Gmail or Hotmail; while a company domain doesn’t ensure the user is not a scammer, it is easier to verify. Sensitive information before the interview or offer Scammers may try to solicit your personal information by asking you to fill out a credit report on a suspicious website or set up a bank account for the purpose of stealing your identity. If the recruiter asks you to share sensitive information like your address, bank account details, tax ID number or social security number, be wary. Typically, only contact information, resume, references and salary expectations should be necessary early on in the process. Funds trading hands The goal of any job is to receive payment for your work, not to pay to work. Do not trust a company or recruiter that asks you to send money to secure a job — once payment is received the account will be deactivated and your money will be lost. Similarly, reputable companies will not ask you to transfer or receive funds on behalf of someone else. This is an immediate red flag that the job in question is a scam. To avoid falling victim to this type of scam, be cautious if you receive a job offer over LinkedIn and other recruiting platforms. Fraudsters may pose as human resource employees or other representatives from well-known companies in order to gain your trust and convince you that their job offer is legitimate. As always — if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you believe you've received a fake job offer message, report it to the site owners and delete it immediately. If you know someone who is looking for work, pass along this message so they can be aware of some of the red flags of recruiting scams.",scam,"Career scammers are targeting job seekers using LinkedIn to reach out with fake offers and requesting personal information.

Crocodile of Wall Street Rendered Toothless as Authorities Bite Back,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=crocodile-of-wall-street-rendered-toothless-as-authorities-bite-back,"By: Martin Kenney, managing partner with Martin Kenney & Co., Solicitors The sums involved in the latest high-profile cryptocurrency fraud are mind-blowing. A self-proclaimed amateur rapper nicknamed the “Crocodile of Wall Street,” Heather Morgan, along with her husband Ilya Lichtenstein, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to allegedly launder $4.5 billion in stolen Bitcoin last month. Equally astonishing is the success of the U.S. Justice Department in retrieving assets in this case — it has reportedly recovered $3.6 billion of the digital currency after seizing the couple’s digital wallets. While this still leaves approximately $1 billion outstanding, it remains a tremendous feat. One can only hope that the recovery will continue to grow in size as the investigation develops. The couple, bailed for $8 million between them, are alleged to have laundered huge sums of Bitcoin stolen in a 2016 hack. The hacker, which the DOJ has not claimed was either Morgan or Lichtenstein, targeted a coin exchange called Bitfinex , stealing 119,754 bitcoins. The theft was so significant that it knocked 20% off the value of Bitcoin after the news of the hack broke. Equally staggering is the value of hack—originally around $71 million—which has shot up in a comparatively short number of years, owing to the volatile upward growth in Bitcoin’s value. The fact that the U.S. authorities were able to track the Bitcoin movements here is testament that digital currencies are no longer the opaque tender they once were, which gives asset recovery specialists cause for hope as we move forward. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said of the events, “Today’s arrests, and the Department’s largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals. Comments by U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia were particularly interesting, illustrating a change in position by the authorities toward digital currencies. Graves said that such thefts as those alleged by Lichtenstein and Morgan “could undermine confidence in cryptocurrency.” The underlying message appears to signal a seismic shift in attitude toward digital currencies — from representing all that is wrong with the world of money laundering to a point where U.S. officials are concerned about digital currency platforms being damaged by hacks. Digital currencies are becoming increasingly common. Companies such as Tesla now accept certain digital currencies as a form of payment (in this case Dogecoin, which can be used to buy Tesla merchandise). As their popularity grows, those who once robbed banks will likely swap their shotguns and masks for computers and high-powered servers to enact their crimes. As they do, those who track assets are already penetrating the layers by which such crooks seek to hide their loot. “Chain Hopping” — the process of moving and shifting digital currency in an attempt to befuddle those seeking to follow money laundering chains — is no different notionally than the placing, layering and integration that anti-money laundering specialists are familiar with. Fortunately, it is possible to track digital currency movements, with outfits such as Chainalysis and other experts now leading the way in the field. The investigators involved in the Lichtenstein/Morgan case should be congratulated for their efforts. If their suspicions are proven to be correct, the couple’s prosecution will serve as a deterrent to others of a similar ilk. The recovery of the billions of dollars in value sends a further message: If you are going to commit such crimes, not only will you stand to lose your liberty, but your ill-gotten gains can and will be targeted too. Crime must not pay, and our best weapon against crime is having meaningful deterrents that can be employed by those with the skills and determination to implement them, including confiscation of wealth.",money laundering,"Graves said that such thefts as those alleged by Lichtenstein and Morgan “could undermine confidence in cryptocurrency.” The underlying message appears to signal a seismic shift in attitude toward digital currencies — from representing all that is wrong with the world of money laundering to a point where U.S. officials are concerned about digital currency platforms being damaged by hacks. “Chain Hopping” — the process of moving and shifting digital currency in an attempt to befuddle those seeking to follow money laundering chains — is no different notionally than the placing, layering and integration that anti-money laundering specialists are familiar with."
"Member Spotlight: Diana Muyibi, Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship Recipient",ACFE Staff,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=member-spotlight-diana-muyibi-ritchie-jennings-memorial-scholarship,"Diana Muyibi is a graduate student studying at State University of New York (SUNY), Old Westbury and also a proud past recipient of the ACFE’s Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship. Diana is in the Master of Science in forensic accounting program and is expected to graduate this spring. Currently, she is a member of the Long Island Chapter of the ACFE, the National Association of Black Accountants and the National Society of Collegiate Scholars, and she participates as a volunteer for the Justice for Fraud Victims Project at SUNY Old Westbury along with other programs. How did you hear about the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship and what made you decide to apply? I was initially informed about the ACFE and the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship by my professor, Dr. David Glodstein, CFE, CPA, who played a major role in motivating and encouraging me to apply for the scholarship. After enrolling in fraud examination and white-collar crime courses with him, I decided to change my major from the M.S. in accounting program at SUNY Old Westbury to forensic accounting. The course material was very engaging, and my professor was a key proponent of my desire to delve deeply into the theories and components of fraud examination, deterrence and detection. To this day, I am still enthused after being selected as a recipient of the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship. It was the first scholarship that I had ever applied for, and being selected as the top recipient was an accomplishment that I will never forget and will forever be grateful for. I celebrated the great news with Dr. Glodstein, my classmates, SUNY Old Westbury’s school of business, the Nassau County District Attorney’s Office in Long Island and my wonderful family, who continue to motivate me and my passion for the forensic accounting and fraud examination profession. How did you become passionate about fighting fraud? I became passionate about fighting fraud after learning about who the victims of fraud are and understanding how fraud and financial accounting scandals impact us all. It is important to note that there are both direct and indirect victims of fraud. Indirect victims of fraud include the families of perpetrators who rely on the financial responsibilities associated with ill-gotten gains. As I reflected on my childhood experiences, I realized that I too had been a victim of fraud; protecting potential victims from these experiences is what fuels my desire for this profession. Participating in the Justice for Fraud Victim’s Project at SUNY Old Westbury, reaching out to local underrepresented communities and small businesses that may have been impacted by fraud, has been a fulfilling experience. It is important that I continue to dedicate my assistance to this initiative because not only will it aid in spreading awareness of the importance of fraud detection and prevention, but it will also prevent people from experiencing the harsh impacts of fraud and the same financial hardships that I did in my childhood. How do you balance your volunteer work with your graduate program and anti-fraud work? Time management is an important skill I have developed with balancing the demands from my graduate program and anti-fraud work. As a member of the ACFE’s Long Island Chapter, the National Association of Black Accountants and the National Society of Collegiate Scholars, I participated in the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and TCE program, where I gave tax preparation assistance to demographic groups who may be vulnerable to tax fraud. As previously mentioned, I am also a volunteer in the Justice for Fraud Victim's Project at SUNY Old Westbury. In conjunction with the applied learning aspect of my graduate program in forensic accounting and my anti-fraud work, these programs have allowed me to participate in organizations that provide experiential based learning when confronting real world complications that are associated with fraud investigation and white-collar crime. What are some things you hope to accomplish in the anti-fraud field? I am currently studying for the CFE exam and am looking forward to obtaining my credential and engaging as an expert witness in the months to come. This would signify a major short-term accomplishment for me in the anti-fraud field. Long-term and over the span of my career, I aim toward becoming a skilled pioneer in this profession and plan on mentoring, motivating and inspiring future fraud fighters who are interested in developing skills related to the anti-fraud profession. For this to be possible, it is important that I continue to develop and utilize accounting, auditing and investigative techniques to become a dynamic and experienced leader in this profession. What advice do you have for students who are interested in applying for the scholarship? For current students who are interested in applying for the ACFE’s Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship, I would recommend that they build relationships with their professors and members of their community who are dedicated to the anti-fraud profession. These people have years of experience offering guidance to past graduates and professionals who have gone on to be pioneers in their respective fields. These connections will provide students with opportunities to expand their own network and position themselves for success in their prospective anti-fraud careers. The anti-fraud profession is a very rewarding career path, and it can be extremely fulfilling to those who are passionate about assisting both their community and businesses that may have been impacted by fraud. The ACFE’s Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship offers great benefits that assist students with covering tuition and fees. As an added incentive, the scholarship also awards a one-year ACFE Student Membership that provides students with the ability to expand their network and directly engage with professionals in the anti-fraud field. Being recognized by the ACFE Foundation has been an honor and a great privilege and, as a member, I will forever be motivated by its service to the global community and anti-fraud professionals around the world. Through the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship , the ACFE Foundation supports the education of students who have an interest in pursuing a career in fraud examination. The scholarship provides an opportunity for students to advance their education and anti-fraud career paths through the generosity of individuals like you. To help support the ACFE Foundation, donate today.",fraud investigation,"In conjunction with the applied learning aspect of my graduate program in forensic accounting and my anti-fraud work, these programs have allowed me to participate in organizations that provide experiential based learning when confronting real world complications that are associated with fraud investigation and white-collar crime."
Fraud Talk: Following the Breadcrumbs-Tracing Cryptocurrencies in Fraud Investigations,ACFE Staff,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=fraud-talk-following-the-breadcrumbs-crypto,"In this episode, Larry Nielsen, a detective who has spent the last several years teaching himself about cryptocurrencies, shares advice for fraud examiners who are interested in expanding their toolkits to accommodate cryptocurrency investigations. He also discusses some of his experiences tracing cryptocurrencies in both a law enforcement capacity and as a consultant. In the excerpt below from episode 117 , Larry talks with Mason Wilder, CFE, about how prevalent cryptocurrency is in his fraud work, and how crypto is being used in traditional crime as a new medium. Nielsen : I'm just going to make this real simple and I'll tell you that last year in 2021, I don't believe a single day went by that I didn't have at least one cryptocurrency-related crime that I was investigating now. I don't mean that I got a new crime each day, but it was just, I don't think a day went by that. I wasn't at least investigating one, and most of the time I had multiple cases that I was looking at involving cryptocurrency. Wilder : Can you walk us through some of the types or give us some examples, you don't have to get too specific on details or get yourself in trouble or anything, but what are some of the investigations that you've seen in the last year? Nielsen : No, that's okay. A lot of the scams and fraud cases that you would see with regular Fiat currency, they translate right over to cryptocurrency. The bad actors are changing the media from Fiat to crypto but for example, the romance scam cases, the grandparent scam cases. Now let's say instead of they still do the Fiat currency, but for the crypto ones instead of them calling a grandparent on the phone and saying, ""Hey, we have your grandson here. He has been arrested, you need to go wire us $10,000 from your bank to this bank account and we'll let him go,” instead of that, now they're saying, “Hey, you need to go to this Bitcoin kiosk this cryptocurrency and you need to send us X amount of Bitcoin,” for example. They send it to another, they give them a wallet address to send it to, that's one example, and then we have the SIM swap cases where it's just a straight-up theft of someone else's cryptocurrency, again, it's traditional crimes, but a different medium.",scam,"A lot of the scams and fraud cases that you would see with regular Fiat currency, they translate right over to cryptocurrency.

Are You Ready to Seize Some Cryptocurrency?,"Mason Wilder,  CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=are-you-ready-to-seize-some-cryptocurrency,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in early February 2022 that they had arrested two individuals , Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan. When the couple was arrested in connection with the theft of cryptocurrency from the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange in 2016 and subsequent laundering of the proceeds, it led to one of the most valuable seizures of illicit proceeds in law enforcement history. It also drew the public’s attention with many poking fun at the couple’s personas as crypto-caricatures and Morgan’s “Razzlekhan” alter ego, star of numerous “sexy horror comedy” rap videos. As tempting as it is to pile on, there is a bigger and more important message in the context of this salacious story — if fraud examiners want to succeed in recovering fraud losses going forward, they’re going to need to be prepared to identify cryptocurrency involvement in schemes, trace the related transactions and then acquire court orders that might include the seizure of digital assets. The official figure featured in most headlines related to the couple’s arrest was $3.6 billion in cryptocurrency. While that eye-popping amount distorts the scale of the original crime (the stolen cryptocurrency was only worth $71 million at the time), it should serve as a warning for criminals who believe that transacting in cryptocurrency will protect their ill-gotten loot. Furthermore, it should encourage other law enforcement agencies and agents to develop the tracing and seizure protocols that could help them recover such a windfall. In 2021, cryptocurrency addresses, or digital wallets known to be associated with illicit activity, took in $14 billion worth of cryptocurrency — which was a 79% increase from 2020 according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. Although that figure represents only a miniscule fraction of the $15.8 trillion total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021, illustrating that while the vast majority of activity is not illicit, it is still a huge amount of funds that could potentially be targeted by authorities in recovery efforts. High-profile seizures of cryptocurrency funds related to crimes are a recent phenomenon, but far from unprecedented. During the fiscal year 2021, 93% of the assets seized by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) were cryptocurrencies . Valued at a total of $3.5 billion, almost one-third of that total came from the seizure of funds related to the original Silk Road dark web marketplace. Other notable cases contributing to the IRS’s 2021 cryptocurrency haul included a Microsoft software developer’s insider fraud, and the operator of a dark web money laundering service named Bitcoin Fog that handled more than 1 billion bitcoins. Another newsworthy seizure of illicit cryptocurrency occurred in June 2021 when the DOJ seized 63.7 bitcoins, then valued at $2.3 million, that were paid to criminals who carried out a ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline. Several of these law enforcement seizures occurred after the agencies reportedly obtained digital files that included private encryption keys the agencies used to access digital wallets and transfer cryptocurrency into their control. Many jurisdictions now require cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallet providers and other cryptocurrency-related money services to implement anti-money laundering (AML) controls and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols to collect information about their customers that can be targeted in court orders. However, turning over custody of a customer’s cryptocurrency is not a common practice since many jurisdictions classify cryptocurrency differently or have not yet settled regulations related to cryptocurrency’s status as property or currency. Public and private organizations are responding to this increase in cryptocurrency utilization by criminals; shortly after the arrest of Lichtenstein and Morgan, the DOJ announced a new National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to combat the use of digital assets in crimes. Private companies such as CipherTrace, Chainalysis, Maltego, Palantir and others are rapidly developing and expanding cryptocurrency-related capabilities like tracing and blockchain forensics, with some of them offering certificate programs. Fraud examiners in both the public and private sectors can expect to encounter cryptocurrencies as the technology is more broadly adopted. If they are not prepared to identify, trace and recover illicit cryptocurrency they will be missing out on the chance to participate in a seizure like those mentioned above. If they do not seek out training or educate themselves on this emerging anti-fraud field and stay up to date with regulations and legal precedents it may be to the detriment of their employers or clients.",money laundering,"Other notable cases contributing to the IRS’s 2021 cryptocurrency haul included a Microsoft software developer’s insider fraud, and the operator of a dark web money laundering service named Bitcoin Fog that handled more than 1 billion bitcoins.

Charity Fraud: How to Donate Without Becoming a Victim of a Scam,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=charity-fraud-how-to-donate-without-becoming-a-scam-victim,"By: Giancarlo Berrocal, CFE How many times have you seen an ad on social media asking you to donate to a cause? The reality is that many of us have a generous heart that prompts us to act and promote just causes like increasing research to fight breast cancer, protecting the environment or providing natural disaster aid in a developing country. Our natural tendency is to sympathize with these causes, which often compels us to donate money and/or property. Unfortunately, not all causes we are called to join have a noble motive; some of them are organized by unscrupulous individuals who take advantage of our generosity to steal our money. But how can you donate without being a victim of a charity scam? Is there a bulletproof way to give you the peace of mind that your contributions are going to the desired cause? According to Giving USA’s 2021 annual report , Americans (individuals and corporations) gave around $471 billion to charity in 2021. To put it into perspective, America’s generous giving is more than Austria’s gross domestic product. Typically, generosity is a sign of a nation’s prosperity and good values, especially in difficult economic times. Nonetheless, giving to charity also poses certain risks and challenges. The FBI’s 2020 IC3 Annual Report showed an increase in charity fraud cases in recent years. Reported charity fraud accounted for $4.4 million in losses, which has increased more than twofold since 2018. Charity fraud is not only financially detrimental to donors, but also to an individual’s trust in charitable organizations, which affects legitimate charities. According to the Give.org Donor Trust Report 2021 , “Trust is considered highly important in the giving process. However, self-reported reliance on trust as a giving indicator has eroded over the past 4 years.” According to the Donor Trust Report 2020 , individuals are more likely to trust a charitable organization when they exhibit the following factors: evaluation by a third-party independent organization, name recognition and accomplishments shared by the organization. However, these factors alone may not be enough to prevent and deter charity fraud. There are certain red flags you should pay attention to in order to avoid being a victim of this type of scam. Red Flags of Charity Fraud Pressure to donate — Fraudsters will try to instill a “sense of urgency” in the victim’s mind to make them donate immediately. New charitable organization — Some scammers will create an organization after a major event (earthquake, COVID-19 pandemic, etc.) for the purpose of defrauding individuals. Typically, the name of the organization cannot be found online using basic online searching tools. Use of certain payment methods — Scammers usually prefer cryptocurrencies, gift cards and wire transfers as a form of payment to receive donations. Less than 65% of donations go to intended cause — BBB Wise Giving Alliance recommends that any charitable organization should spend at least 65% proceeds in charity’s program activities. Use of robocalls/automated calls — Be suspicious of robocalls trying to raise money. These robocalls are most likely scams. Negative media/reviews — If a charitable organization is being flagged in social media or the press for dubious practices or scams/fraudulent conduct, then you should refrain from making any donation. Steps to Avoid Charity Scams Look up the organization’s website to verify its authenticity. Do not click on links or download attachments sent by a purported organization via email/texts. Be aware of crowdfunding — if a person is raising money using crowdfunding campaign through a fundraising platform such as GoFundMe, make sure you know or trust the person who is behind the campaign. Crowdfunding is easy to set up and the legitimacy of the fundraising campaign is difficult to verify. Use online resources to verify the charitable organization’s review and credibility. You can use these free resources such as Charity Watch, Charity Navigator, and BBB Wise Giving Alliance. Use a check or credit card to make your donations. Look at the charitable organization’s IRS tax exempt status. Verify the charitable organization’s registration status in your state. How to Report Charity Fraud If you become a victim of charity fraud, report your case immediately to: The Federal Trade Commission National Center for Disaster Fraud The FBI Also, contact your State Consumer Protection Office.",scam,"But how can you donate without being a victim of a charity scam?

"Member Spotlight: Michael Mingo-Dabney, CFE",Rihonna Scoggins,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=member-spotlight-michael-mingo-dabney-cfe,"Michael Mingo-Dabney, CFE, began his career as an anti-fraud professional after learning about the prevalent embezzlement and money laundering corrupting a town in Colombia while serving as a volunteer for the Peace Corps. Michael continues his work against fraud as a fraud analyst for C2 Alaska, as well as serving as a contractor for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Enforcement. How did you become passionate about fighting fraud? My passion for anti-fraud efforts stemmed from my interest in international economic development, which I studied at George Mason University (GMU) with a minor in economics. My favorite courses were the development-based subjects centered on African and Latin American nations. A major component of why economic development never seemed to have the impact it was meant to have — despite billions of investment from first-world nations — was because of funds “slipping through the cracks” into the hands of politicians and corrupt officials. Fast forward to July 2017 when I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Colombia. After I was assigned my town of service and relocated to Tomarrazon, La Guajira, I heard countless stories from my site mate and locals about how certain institutions installed in the pueblos (small towns) were no longer in service due to a lack of necessary funding. Some personal investigating led me to discover there had been an exorbitant amount of fraudulent activity happening for quite some time. When I spoke to locals in Tomarrazon and the capital city of Riohacha, combined with some resources at the mayor’s office, I found articles about officials being arrested for embezzlement and money laundering. Seeing the negative impact of those embezzled funds, which were supposed to go to local schools but were instead used for luxury purchases and political bribes, broke my heart. Simultaneously, it sparked a fire in me to do what I could to combat that sort of activity. How did you get to your current role? The path to my current role could be described as fumbling my way through life as an overzealous brute wanting to take down anything and everything that resembled fraud. After leaving the Peace Corps, I knew that I wanted to have a career in fighting fraud — the only question was how? Almost immediately, I explored going back to school to study accounting. I ended up going back to GMU and applying for a graduate certificate in forensic accounting. I knew I had made the right choice when I got accepted and started my courses. The technical and soft skills I learned in that program will stay with me forever. I also found a lifelong mentor in a professor during that time, and he has advised me ever since. When we would speak during office hours about what I wanted to do, he saw the internal fire I had and worked with me to achieve my goal. During one of his courses, I learned about the CFE credential. As I studied, I was also working as a contracted auditor at a Big Four firm. I liked audit, as it was the first real experience that allowed me to utilize the skills I was learning from my graduate courses. But audit only allowed me to point out the problems, not be a part of the solution. So, I left that position and joined a boutique litigation consulting firm as a forensic cost consultant. In that role, I was able to apply all my forensic accounting knowledge, while learning soft skills; at the time, I seriously underestimated the importance of those soft skills that have since enabled me to mature professionally. While working for the consulting firm, I studied for and passed the CFE exams. Having the CFE is what led me to obtain the position that I have now as a fraud analyst II for C2 Alaska. I serve as a contractor for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Enforcement – Office of Investigation and Market Analytics.What are challenges you face as a fraud analyst? The biggest challenge is staying ahead of the curve. As much we hate to admit it, fraudsters are incredibly intelligent people. Their creative ways of thinking and utilizing everyday programs and tools never cease to fascinate me. The diverse methods of committing fraud that go beyond what we learned about in graduate school prove to be a challenge every day. Though it can be frustrating, it's also equally fun to play the game and keep up with, and attempt to stay one step ahead, of them. It forces me to learn things I never knew I would need to — for instance, how to think like a fraudster. The more I uncover in my work, the more I find myself reading about what those who have come before me have experienced. Books like “Why They Do It” by Eugene Soltes and “The Other Side of Yesterday” by Gary A. Foster have changed my foundational thinking. I do my best every day to take the lessons from books like these and apply them to a modern way of thinking in order to combat the growing popularity of ""new"" methods of fraud like cryptocurrency fraud. I've gradually steered further and further away from the typical accounting financial statements and closer to the digital asset realm. Thus, self-teaching to stay ahead is a challenge I both enjoy and endure. What is an important lesson you’ve learned in your career? The most important lesson I’ve learned throughout every step of my career is that imperfection is okay. From my sophomore year of college until I graduated and first experienced the “real world,” I was a perfectionist. So much so that it proved to be detrimental to professional relationships I tried to cultivate. I’ve always had high standards for myself; thus, when I worked with others, I projected those expectations of perfection on them as well. In every role that I’ve held, from internships to my current one, I’ve learned from the people who have mentored me and whom I’ve worked alongside. Each of them, gradually, softened my abrasive exterior and made me easier to work with. In addition, they taught me to make space for accepting mistakes, as long as I learned from them and never made the same one twice. As an African American in this field, I face subtle but unrelenting pressures to compete with my peers and be among the best — if I am not the best myself. It’s common for those of us in the African American community to impose pressures on ourselves in addition to those placed on us by our superiors and peers. Working in the increasingly diverse field of accounting and anti-fraud has encouraged me to be a sponge and learn from those around me. I’ve found that adopting other methods of thinking to my own has allowed me to progress in my career at a much faster rate than that perfectionist version of myself ever could have. What is important to you about being a CFE? Obtaining the CFE credential was a professional milestone. It was more than a credential to me — it was a representation of what I wanted, and still want, to become. I believe the CFE represents a lifestyle choice. Those who have chosen to dedicate their lives to fighting fraud stand as a line of defense for victims of monetary deceit. Being a CFE means that we represent not only ourselves, but also those who trust us as professionals to operate in their best interests and to ensure the prosecution of those who don't. It is a commitment to myself and those people that I give my best effort every day. That no matter what challenges I face, I will overcome them and use those lessons to teach those who come after me.

What You Should Know About Money Mules,"Ron Cresswell,  J.D., CFE",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=what-you-should-know-about-money-mules,"The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) was created in 1998 to combat cybercrime, terrorism and other forms of organized crime. Since 2016, Europol has conducted annual anti-money laundering operations known as European Money Mule Actions, or EMMA. On December 2, 2021, Europol announced the results of EMMA 7 , which was conducted from September to November 2021 with the cooperation of 26 countries and multiple law enforcement partners, financial institutions and private-sector businesses. According to Europol, EMMA 7 resulted in 1,803 arrests and prevented €67.5 million in potential losses. The operation also identified 18,351 money mules. These money mules were used to launder money for various online scams, including sim-swapping, man in the middle attacks, e-commerce fraud and phishing. As EMMA 7 illustrates, money mules continue to play a key role in international money laundering operations. Accordingly, both Europol and the FBI have recently stepped up their efforts to raise public awareness about money mules and how to avoid becoming one. What Are Money Mules? A money mule is a person who transfers illegally acquired funds at the direction of a third party. Money mules generally receive a commission, in either a flat fee or percentage, for moving the money. In the most common type of money mule scheme, the criminal first deposits money into the mule’s bank account. The mule is then directed to transfer the money to another account or to withdraw the money in cash and deliver it to another party. The goal is to obscure the illegal origin of the money. Types of Money Mules The FBI classifies money mules into three types: Complicit mules — these individuals know that they are money mules and are complicit in the underlying criminal scheme. They might regularly open bank accounts at different financial institutions, openly advertise their services and recruit other mules. Witting mules — these are people who disregard the warning signs that they are involved in illegal activities. They might have received and ignored previous warnings from bank personnel. Many witting mules began as unwitting mules. Unwitting mules — these individuals do not know that they are involved in a criminal scheme. They might genuinely believe that their activities are helping someone (e.g., their employer, an acquaintance or their romantic partner). Unwitting mules are typically recruited as part of a scam. How Unwitting Mules Are Recruited Many unwitting mules are recruited through job offers with promises of easy money or instant cash. In such cases, the potential mule may be asked to open a bank account, a cryptocurrency wallet or a business in their name. The initial communication may be an unsolicited email or instant message, a pop-up ad, or a job posting on social media, an online forum or a job website. Another common recruiting tool is the romance scam. In a romance scam, a criminal adopts a false online identity to gain a victim’s trust and affection. The criminal then convinces the victim to receive deposits and transfer funds through the victim’s financial accounts. Unwitting mules may also be recruited through extortion or investment schemes. While anyone can be recruited as a money mule, the most targeted groups include college students, the unemployed, newly immigrated individuals and the elderly. How to Avoid Becoming an Unwitting Mule To avoid becoming an unwitting money mule, look for the following red flags: Any request to move money through your bank account in exchange for payment. A job offer that asks you to receive company funds into your personal account, or asks you to open a new bank account. An employer that claims to be an overseas company seeking a local agent or representative (often to avoid high transaction fees or local taxes). Any job posting that involves transferring money. A job posting that is poorly written, vague, does not describe the job duties, or does not include education and experience requirements. An acquaintance or romantic partner who asks you to receive or transfer funds. Money mules can be charged with serious crimes that include substantial fines and long prison sentences. Therefore, any request to accept or transfer funds should be treated with great suspicion.","money laundering, scam","Since 2016, Europol has conducted annual anti-money laundering operations known as European Money Mule Actions, or EMMA.

"Member Spotlight: Matthew Stock, J.D., CFE, CPA",ACFE Staff,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=member-spotlight-matthew-stock,"Matthew Stock, J.D., CFE, CPA, is the director of the Whistleblower Rewards Practice at Zuckerman Law. At Zuckerman Law, he leverages his experience as an attorney and external auditor to assist whistleblowers to investigate and disclose complex financial frauds to the government. His practice focuses on representing whistleblowers in reward cases before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). How did you become passionate about fighting fraud? I first became passionate about fighting fraud after witnessing the fallout from the major accounting scandals in the early 2000s (Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Global Crossing). I decided early on to focus my education and experience on accounting and fraud detection, which led to a position as an external auditor at a Big 4 accounting firm. My passion for fighting fraud was further emboldened after the collapse of Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme and the financial crisis that cost the U.S. approximately $20 trillion. I was frustrated to learn that many of these scandals could have been detected and halted years prior to their ultimate collapses if the companies or government agencies had acted on whistleblowers’ disclosures. This prompted me to work at a whistleblower law firm after graduating from law school. Whistleblower reward programs have proven to be a very effective tool in fighting fraud. Since the inception of the SEC whistleblower program , enforcement matters brought using information from whistleblowers have resulted in orders for nearly $5 billion in total monetary sanctions and the return of more than $1.3 billion to harmed investors . Similarly, whistleblower complaints brought under the False Claims Act have enabled the government to recover more than $64 billion . What are some of the biggest challenges you face in working with whistleblowers and whistleblowing cases? My practice focuses on representing whistleblowers in reward cases before the SEC, CFTC and IRS. Under these whistleblower programs, whistleblowers are eligible to receive up to 30% of the government’s collected monetary sanctions in a successful enforcement action as a reward. The path to obtaining a whistleblower reward is lengthy and complex, and each whistleblower program has unique rules and procedures. While there are countless challenges and issues when reporting to the government, I frequently assist whistleblowers with the following issues: Reporting anonymously : Determining whether a whistleblower can submit tips anonymously to the government and be eligible for an award (e.g., the SEC and CFTC whistleblower programs allow whistleblowers to submit tips anonymously if represented by counsel and be eligible for an award, whereas the IRS whistleblower program does not allow whistleblowers who report anonymously to be eligible for an award). Eligibility for a reward : Determining whether a whistleblower must take certain steps before reporting to the government to be eligible for an award (e.g., the SEC whistleblower program has different eligibility rules for auditors based on their relation to the company and how they obtained the information). Maximizing a reward : Determining whether a whistleblower should take (or avoid taking) certain actions that could increase or decrease the size of their future reward and identifying potential “related action” awards. Information and evidence : Determining the information and evidence to include (or exclude) from a submission to the government (e.g., the government does not want information that may violate the company’s attorney-client privilege, such as emails that involve advice from inside or outside counsel). Whistleblower protections : Determining which laws protect a whistleblower’s particular disclosure (both internal and external) and if the whistleblower suffers retaliation, devising a strategy to maximize their recovery and protect their career. I could write a short book on this section alone but, in summary, there are endless issues and challenges that whistleblowers face when reporting to the government. Do you have any advice for people who are considering blowing the whistle? I strongly suggest that they consult with an experienced attorney before blowing the whistle. At a minimum, a prospective whistleblower should be aware of the federal and state whistleblower reward and protection laws that could potentially apply to their whistleblowing and develop an effective strategy to protect their interests and achieve their objectives. Whistleblowers should get sound advice about the potential risks of stepping forward and make sure that they do not take any actions that could undermine their potential whistleblower reward or retaliation claims — or result in potential liability. Many people are surprised to learn that not all forms of whistleblowing are protected, and certain actions by the whistleblower could expose them to significant civil or even criminal liability (e.g., disclosing a suspicious activity report). What is a memorable case or project that you have worked on? I cannot provide specific details about my cases due to their confidential nature, however, I will say that I have had the privilege of representing many courageous whistleblowers whose information played a critical role in the government’s ability to halt large Ponzi schemes , investment scams, tax fraud and significant violations at publicly traded companies. Many of these successful enforcement actions returned significant funds to harmed investors. My proudest moments are when I have the opportunity to tell my clients about the tremendous impact of their whistleblowing and to inform them that they will be receiving a reward. How do you think the CFE credential has helped your career? In my experience, most whistleblowers appreciate an attorney who can both navigate the legal process as well as understand and investigate the complex frauds that they are seeking to report. The CFE credential has strengthened my ability to collaborate with clients to perform in-depth investigations to uncover fraud and my legal training enables me to distill the facts into a cogent submission that provides a roadmap for a successful enforcement action. The CFE credential has been especially helpful as I work with the talented attorneys and accountants at the SEC, CFTC and IRS to assist them in investigating fraud schemes, protecting investors and holding fraudsters accountable.

Top 5 Fraud-Related Movies,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=top-5-fraud-related-movies,"By: Cindy Greenman, CFE For me, one thing that came about during the pandemic is that my husband and I love watching movies together. We both have our favorite genres. He prefers the shoot-’em-up action thrillers. I enjoy comedies and dramas. But I especially enjoy a movie that involves parts of my career in the anti-fraud profession. Hollywood is no stranger to glamorizing the world of fraud. There are many films and television shows out there that cover this topic, and often they are criticized for their portrayal and romanticizing of crimes. Some critics have suggested that these types of portrayals have led to copycat criminals. There is even a film festival in New Zealand focused solely on fraud. The NZ International Fraud Film Festival only includes movies based on scams, forgery, tax evasion and corruption. Recently, on an ACFE Community discussion post, a question was posed: What is your favorite fraud movie? Well, here are the results of that post, as well as me posing this same question on the ACFE LinkedIn group . I list these in no particular order, only that they are the top five mentioned in both surveys*. All the Queen’s Horses (2017) This documentary was the project of professor Kelly Richmond-Pope. She recounts the story of Rita Crundwell who managed to embezzle more than $53 million from her small hometown while working as the city clerk for over 20 years. As a professor myself, I assign this documentary to all of my auditing students as well as my forensic accounting students. Some of the main lessons from this documentary are that 1) people see what they want to see, until it is right in front of them and they can no longer deny the truth, 2) smaller organizations are often the most at risk, and 3) the “we’re all family” type atmosphere makes it more difficult to distrust or question our coworkers. Catch Me If You Can (2002) Even though the movie is nearly 20 years old, it’s still one of the top-rated movies on financial fraud based on the true yet hard-to-believe story of Frank Abagnale. Even before Abagnale turned 19 years old, he was worth millions of dollars. Eventually, he poses as a pilot of a major airline, a surgical doctor, a prosecuting attorney and other professionals without a high school education. This movie demonstrates that age is meaningless. Abagnale started his crimes at 16, stealing his father’s credit card. It wasn’t until many years later that he was convicted of cashing over $2.5 million in bad checks. The movie illustrates how confidence is truly the key. The Accountant (2016) In the movie, the accountant is much more than a number cruncher. He has Asperger’s syndrome, which is on Autism spectrum, and the film portrays him using his disability to quickly decipher the books for crime bosses. The movie has many twists and turns and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. It is an action thriller with an accounting backdrop. Lessons we can learn from this movie are: There’s more than meets the eye. Auditing is more than a desk job. Do your due diligence when selecting clients and be prepared for anything. Accounting can be fun and exciting! The Wolf of Wall Street This film is based on the true-life story of Jordan Belfort, a financial broker who became enormously wealthy by committing fraud and stock market manipulation. The movie portrays the extravagant lifestyle of Belfort as he drinks, drugs and sexes his way through his early 20s, giving the SEC and FBI ample opportunity to investigate. A little-known fact: Belfort went to federal prison for 22 months where one of his “cube-mates” was Tommy Chong (comedian, actor, activist). It was Chong who convinced Belfort to write his life story, which eventually served as inspiration for the film. As CFEs, we all know doing our own research is best. This movie gives us good reason to keep believing that is true. Their use of a “boiler room” and aggressive sales tactics shows that everyone should complete their own research and ignore the hype. It also tells us, as investigators, to watch out for those aggressive, cocky wheelers and dealers. In fact, one of the six most common behavioral red flags of fraud, according to the ACFE’s Report to the Nations, is a general “wheeler-dealer” attitude. Wizard of Lies (2017) Like many of the films on this list, this one is also based on real-life events. The drama is based on the life and crimes of the late Bernie Madoff, who founded his own company on Wall Street in the 1960s. Over many years his company turned into one of the largest investment funds in the world. His arrest in 2008 revealed the truth behind his multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, the largest in history. The investigator in all of us, as CFEs, should learn a few things from this particular piece of history. Never give up on a hunch. There were a few people who knew something was not right with Madoff’s numbers and kept at it. Sometimes we have to swallow our pride. If it doesn’t make sense to you, it might not make sense to others either. Swallow our pride and ask others to explain it to us. Madoff used complicated quantitative analytics to keep investigators from getting too close. *The survey results are not scientific in any way.",scam,"The NZ International Fraud Film Festival only includes movies based on scams, forgery, tax evasion and corruption."
A Stolen Text Messages Hack That Only Costs $16,Hallie Ayres,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=a-stolen-text-messages-hack-that-only-costs-16-dollars,"A recent investigation by VICE found a major loophole in telecommunications infrastructure. Joseph Cox, the investigative reporter at the center of the story enlisted the help of a friendly hacker to report on a service called Sakari, a company that streamlines mass SMS messaging for businesses. The hacker was able to use the service to reroute all of Cox’s text messages to the hacker’s device, and Cox didn’t receive a single notification about the theft of his number. He just stopped receiving text messages. Sakari offers their SMS marketing services for $16, which is their cheapest plan. It requires the client to add a phone number associated with the account. This number is then used to send and receive text messages, even if that phone number doesn’t actually belong to the company. Sakari does mandate that users sign a Letter of Authorization (LOA) that requires the user to agree that they won’t “conduct any unlawful, harassing, or inappropriate behavior with the text messaging service and phone number,” but Sakari does not send any sort of message to the number in question to confirm this consent. The hacker explained their process as follows: “I used a prepaid card to buy [Sakari’s] $16 per month plan and then after that was done it let me steal numbers just by filling out the LOA with fake info.” The use of prepaid cards makes the perpetrators of these hacks even more difficult to track down. Once the hacker gains access to all the messages being received to a certain number, they can easily find their way into accounts like WhatsApp and Postmates, where the authorization for access depends only on a phone number or a code sent to that number. A new hacking frontier This hack differs from the more common SIM jacking because unlike SIM jacking, from the perspective of the person whose phone number was just stolen, their phone appears completely normal. Another aspect of this hack is that the specific carrier for a phone number is irrelevant. The ease with which this hack can be successfully executed exposes major flaws in telecommunications infrastructure and a lack of regulations around commercial SMS services. After Cox reached out to Sakari, the company implemented a security feature where the newly subscribed phone number receives an automated call and has to report back to Sakari with a security code in order for their account to be fully activated. However, Sakari is only one example of this type of SMS tool. According to one of Cox’s sources, it took only two minutes to find another service that would allow the hack after getting cut off from a different provider. In a statement given to VICE, Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at Electronic Frontier Foundation , an internet civil liberties organization, says that this type of hack “underscores the importance of moving people ... off of ‘login with your phone number’ solutions.” Policy changes as a result In a March 25 response to Cox’s exposé, the communications company Aerialink, which routes text messages, stated, “Wireless carriers will no longer be supporting SMS or MMS text enabling on their respective numbers.” The new protocol is “industry-wide” and “affects all SMS providers in the mobile ecosystem.” Not only does this change affect all major carriers, but it will also change the entire future of companies like Sakari that depend on enabling text messages to run the services they offer. While it’s common for the telecommunications industry to face investigations into ways it may be misusing user data, it’s less likely that these services face interrogation into ways they could be abused by hackers and fraudsters. Cox’s article exposes a vital flaw in these regulations, but it also highlights the meaningful changes that can come about as a result of thoughtful anti-fraud investigation.",fraud investigation,"Cox’s article exposes a vital flaw in these regulations, but it also highlights the meaningful changes that can come about as a result of thoughtful anti-fraud investigation."
Common Money Laundering Risks With Third-Party Payments,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=common-money-laundering-risks-with-third-party-payments,"By Lin Danwan, CFE E-payment through third-party channels or platforms — like Venmo, Cash App, Alipay or WeChat Pay — is widely used in our daily life, especially as COVID-19 spread and stay-at-home restrictions fueled precipitous growth of third-party payments. To clarify, I’m not referring to mobile banking apps or payment apps operated by the banks. Let’s focus on apps that function independently yet connect consumers, merchants and banks to mold a payment loop. Such payment methods bring convenience to individual consumers, making transactions more efficient and flexible. Yet, this model lowers the cost and time to commit crimes and also intensifies fund-flow channels. The associated money laundering risks should not be overlooked. To understand these risks, let’s take a look at the third-party payment flow and bring out the iterated anti-money laundering (AML) measures as well as the major difficulties to implement them. Third-party payment flow Payment processes usually involve five functions: Platform telecommunication service Customer interface Transaction processing Account provision Settlement As an example, let’s take a closer look at a third-party payment transaction process. The chart below illustrates the general funds flow of a payment model: As indicated, an independent third party is involved in the payment loop. It nearly assumes the function of settlement, particularly when the third-party processor establishes a deposit relationship with a financial institution to process payments for its users. Third parties’ deposit account becomes a de facto internal account that financial institutions cannot clearly dissect. Think about it this way. The whole payment process is divided into separate areas: Payment instructions are retained by third parties. Financial institutions do not “see” the details of the transactions, only deposits to and withdrawals from the third-party payment service. Financial institutions have no knowledge of the individuals or the sellers. Characteristics and risks Generally, we may find these common difficulties when attempting to manage AML risks associated with third-party payment vendors: ANONYMITY Customer identity is obfuscated. A perpetrator may be allowed to access these types of payment services, without disclosing their identity to the third party. Or they use a false name to circumvent the KYC screening. It’s even possible that multiple accounts may be controlled by one perpetrator through one third-party platform. In this logic, suspicious names cannot be effectively detected. It makes cashing out easier. Transaction parties’ identities are not always known when the transactions initially take place, and those bank account names are not unveiled until settlement is fully completed, which provides a convenient time gap for perpetrators to take advantage of. Fund source and beneficiary are disguised. Given that the payment loop is segregated, and that relevant data is separately preserved by different interested parties, perpetrators can take advantage of this segregation model so as to disguise the origin and destination of the funds. Transaction due diligence and authenticity is more difficult. Transaction counterparties are rarely accurately recorded, so AML officers encounter more challenges when profiling customers and depicting transaction patterns. RAPIDITY Traditional fund transfer is required to go through specific sets of operative steps, which to a certain extent, lowers the fund movement. Third-party payments economize those operations, which means funds are instantly debited and credited, shortening the cycle to perform one criminal transaction. On the other hand, quick fund movement leaves little time to effectively intercept suspicious transactions. EVASIVENESS Perpetrators tend to intensively repeat fund transferals, complicating the fund flows, and consequently break the fund trails. Such smurfing also frustrates the transaction monitoring system, hiding suspicious activities beneath massive scale of data. INEFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT Over the past few years, money laundering through third-party payment vendors has become more synergic, specialized and standardized, involving different action groups and multiple jurisdictions. Also note that that payment models vary from business to business and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Risk control measures also produce varying degrees of effectiveness. In one jurisdiction, reconciling between the regulatory standard, regulated parties’ control effectiveness and customers’ operational convenience is far from easy. Recommended actions and difficulties Regulators are encouraging market participants to take innovative approaches for financial inclusion. To establish a proportionate but not burdensome regulation is crucial. Regulatory guidance and practitioners’ controls can also evolve to better accommodate between the development opportunities and risks. The most imminent and necessary actions rest primarily through the below aspects: Identification of customers and customer profiling, including but not limited to KYC tailored to third-party payment processors. Licensing and responsibilities of third-party payment processors. Operating guidelines, transaction amount limits and internal controls. Enhanced record-keeping by third-party payment vendors. More robust transaction monitoring and suspicious transaction reporting. These AML procedures should be scrupulously carried out throughout the entire transaction process. Currently, when it comes to mitigating money laundering risks, we usually find ambiguity in the terms of service by third-party payment processors, or AML and KYC are not mentioned at all. That is because the delineation of responsibilities varies among payment systems and jurisdictions. However, in the payment loop, the party who manages the account records should undertake AML responsibilities, especially as the information of funds movement heaps up. If third-party payment vendors adapt this mentality, it could hopefully lead to comprehensive monitoring and analysis. Lin Danwan, CFE, has experience in AML and fraud risk management.

7 Warning Signs That May Indicate Fraud Within Your Company,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=7-warning-signs-that-may-indicate-fraud-within-your-company,"By: Rebecca Dunne In organizations, some common types of fraud are unauthorized use of physical and monetary company assets and the misrepresentation of financial statements to make organizations appear more economically successful than what they actually are. According to the ACFE’s 2020 Report to the Nations , organizations with less than 100 employees suffered larger median losses than those of larger companies. In other words, fraud can happen at any organization, no matter the size, so it’s important to understand the warning signs. So, what are the warning signs to look out for? 1. Suspicious financials When budgets are not being met (either being under met, or over met) and financials are not being delivered as timely as they should be, this could indicate a more serious issue. Some questions to ask are: Are there any unusual cash transactions? Are there mismatched payees? Does the payee’s name match the name in the general accounting book? Have there been identical payments cleared to different vendors in the same date range? Do the suppliers of vendors being paid have unprofessional invoices? Are the vendors known as questionable companies? Unfortunately, it can be a warning sign when things look too good to be true. If sales are way above the norm, or if revenues exceed expectations, there may be a case of some dodgy accounting behind the scenes. If businesses have more than one bank account, there may be inappropriate cash movements. What to do: Have regular audits for the accounts and teams. 2. Out-of-character emails If you receive an unusual email, or one which fails to comply to the organization’s usual practices, it could indicate that a scam is underway. Worse, it could signal that an employee’s email account has already been compromised. According to the ACFE’s Fraud in the Wake of COVID-19: Benchmarking Report, September Edition , 83% of anti-fraud professionals who were surveyed have observed an increase in cyberfraud since the pandemic began. What to do: Increase cybersecurity training for employees, specifically focusing on how to recognize phishing attempts and how to comply with the organization’s work-from-home cyber policies. 3. Staff are resisting tighter controls If staff are resistant to new internal control systems, this could be a sign that they are hiding something and do not want to be caught. Of course, there are normal resistances such as not liking change or not wanting additional work to do or processes to follow. However, there may also be something deeper. What to do: Schedule a meeting and have a one-on-one conversation with any employee who has difficulty with the new controls. Figure out where the resistance is coming from and address the issue from that vantage point. 4. Overly close relationships within the business High-risk employees are those who have trusted roles in finance or purchasing. These individuals have more access to company assets, which means they have more opportunity to commit fraud. If there are close relationships among a group of such people, or even among one high-risk individual and a small group of others, it can be a sign of fraud. In kickback scenarios, employees from the company may also have a relationship with a vendor who overcharges the company. As the vendor gets more cash from the company, the insider may earn a return since the two split the difference. What to do: Monitor relations between employees. If it appears people are unusually friendly, talk with them and remind them about the importance of being professional and treating everyone equally, and not having favorites. 5. Travel reimbursement irregularities This area is relatively simple to abuse. If there is little attention paid to such expenses, employees can falsify their expense records. For example, an employee could easily add on a few extra company lunches each month. What to do: Ensure your organization has internal controls in place to monitor all expenses and verify they are legitimate. 6. Unusual employee circumstances Sometimes an employee will need to work late, or they will need to change up their schedule to accommodate an unexpected life event. Of course, throughout the current pandemic, there have been many unusual circumstances that have upended everyone’s day-to-day routine. However, if an unusual pattern emerges, that is worth a closer look. Here are some behaviors to pay attention to: An employee frequently asks to work extra hours. An employee frequently asks to work outside of regular business hours. An employee refuses to share certain tasks. An employee will only work with a certain supplier. What to do: Ensure employees can justify their unusual circumstances. When such requests are made, be sure to follow up. If they want to work late to finish a report, be sure that the report is actually finished. Similarly, security cameras could be used, as well as close audits. 7. Expensive purchases If an employee purchases something expensive, be it a new car, house or a holiday, consider if the purchase aligns with their salary. Does it add up that this has been purchased? As always, there are legitimate circumstances that can explain big purchases — the employee has been saving for it, they just received some winnings or even an inheritance from a loved ones’ will. But, generally, if a pattern of large purchases emerges, this can be a moment to question if their salary justifies the purchases. What to do: Assess if there are other potential warning signs, such as the ones included above. If there are, this may be enough to dig deeper. If you face any of these warning signs, it is important to take a closer look. If necessary, your organization may need to investigate these situations further because, as we all know, fraud can have a hefty effect on any organization.

7 Facts You Should Know About Business Email Compromise Scams,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=7-facts-to-know-business-email-compromise-scams,"By: Ryan Gregory, CFE The Better Business Bureau (BBB) International Investigations Initiative released a report titled “Is That Email Really From ‘The Boss’? The Explosion of Business Email Compromise (BEC) Scams” this past September detailing the staggering losses that U.S. and Canadian companies have experienced due to compromised business email. As summarized in the study, the reported losses (there are many unreported cases, per this report) show that U.S. company losses are in the billions while Canadian companies are in the tens of millions in losses. There is also a note about several Australian companies going out of business due to freight forwarding scams ( a type of BEC fraud ). The study highlights recent arrests made, how BEC scams are perpetrated and how companies can report to law enforcement. The study also emphasizes the need for further verification when payments are requested and emphasizes the importance of employee training to recognize these types of schemes. In order to protect yourself and your company from a BEC attack, you should stay up to date on different tactics and techniques used by fraudsters. Here are a few key pieces of information included in the BBB report that you should know about BEC scams. Falling for the first email: BEC attacks are 10 times more likely to produce a victim if the target answers an initial probe email. Common words and phrases: It helps to know the type of language that fraudsters will use to increase urgency and make their email sound more official. Here are some words and phrases to look out for: “request” (36%), “follow up” (14%),“urgent” or “important” (12%), and “are you available?” or “are you at your desk?” (10%). The effectiveness of training: Before training, employees are 30% likely to click on a malicious link contained within a BEC email. After training, only 2% are likely to click on a link. Lead generation use: It was found that some fraudsters used lead generation services and even signed up for free trails to obtain company and employee information, including names, email addresses and job titles. With these types of services, this information did not come from a breach nor had it been stolen. Rather, it was offered through other companies as a business service. Cyber insurance: This report showed that while few insurance companies cover social engineering, the organizations that do have this coverage available have opted out. Detection: It was noted that programs that are setup to detect spam email and phishing attempts are monitoring for computers that send large volumes of email and may not detect BEC attempts, as they are specifically targeted and are not usually sent out in large volumes. BEC emails often slip through the cracks because they are well-crafted and specific to the recipient. Email domains: This study noted that a security company found domains well into the millions that were very similar to those of real companies. Setting up these domains was very simple and not expensive to create. Always closely study the domain name of an unexpected email, especially when the sender is asking for money or requesting you to take a specific action like opening a file or clicking on a link. A review of email security settings, additional monitoring layering and accounts payable procedures can go a long way in deterring a BEC attack by those attempting to divert company funds. As the anti-fraud expert in your organization, you’ve got a huge responsibility to ensure that each person — from the new hire to the CEO — understands the potentially devastating effects of a BEC scam. Education truly is the key. It could be the difference between moving an email to the junk folder and losing thousands of dollars.",scam,"The Explosion of Business Email Compromise (BEC) Scams” this past September detailing the staggering losses that U.S. and Canadian companies have experienced due to compromised business email.

You Discovered Fraud — Now What? 5 Steps to Take After Suspecting Fraud in Your Company,"Kelly Todd,  CPA/ABV",https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=you-discovered-fraud-now-what,"By: Kelly Todd, CFE Despite efforts to prevent fraud, the unfortunate reality is that it still happens — in fact, according to the ACFE's 2022 Report to the Nations , it is estimated that companies lose 5% of revenue each year to fraud. If you suspect fraud has occurred at your organization, take these immediate action steps: 1. Safeguard potential evidence Preservation of evidence is key. Secure any and all potential evidence — but by all means, avoid the temptation to examine the evidence on your own. Electronic evidence is fragile and easily altered. Did you know that simply turning a computer off or on can alter potential evidence? Secure computers, cellphones and external electronic media sources such as thumb drives. Maintaining the evidence will help your forensic accounting team identify what occurred, who committed the fraud and why. 2. Gather a team Enlist a forensic accountant and computer forensic specialist to help you collect, analyze and store the data. It would be wise to hire an outside financial investigator who is familiar with and experienced in fraud investigations — using an in-house accountant is not appropriate, as they are not as objective as an outside source. In fact, someone on the accounting team may be part of the problem. Retain an employment lawyer to ensure you stay on the right side of the law regarding the rights of the suspected employee. 3. Deal with the suspected employee Don’t fire the suspected employee immediately — it could make gathering evidence much more difficult. Instead, restrict their access to company data. Do not let them remove their computer or any other company items and documents from their office. 4. Notify your insurance provider A crucial fact for employers to know is that you must notify your insurance provider within 30 to 60 days, depending on your policy. Failure to do so could cause a loss of coverage. 5. File proof of loss You will need to document any losses with your insurance provider in a specified time frame. Documenting a claim with an insurance provider takes time to ensure it is properly recorded. It is possible to file an extension should you need one, but be sure not to miss any deadlines or you risk forfeiting coverage. The best way to mitigate fraud risks is to have internal controls and external resources available to prevent them from happening in the first place. Should fraud occur, the initial steps you take in addressing suspected fraud can hinder or greatly help your efforts — don’t make the mistake of collecting evidence and acting without the assistance of a team of forensic specialists and legal professionals.",fraud investigation,"It would be wise to hire an outside financial investigator who is familiar with and experienced in fraud investigations — using an in-house accountant is not appropriate, as they are not as objective as an outside source."
Infamous Fraud Cases of the 21st Century,Guest Blogger,https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=infamous-fraud-cases-of-the-21st-century,"By: ACFE Staff A seemingly endless stream of fraud stories hits the headlines every day. On Monday you could read that an Ivy league-educated financier defrauded his victims of more than $38 million and by Friday, a European soccer star is spending his day in court. It can be disheartening to see these stories splayed across your computer or TV screens. There is, however, a silver lining. If we’ve learned anything from taking history classes in school it’s that understanding the past helps to avoid repeating it. In a new ACFE online self-study course, 10 Infamous Fraud Cases of the 21st Century , we do just that. By exploring 10 notable fraud cases of the 21st century, fraud examiners can identify the methods the major players used to conduct their schemes, and analyze the aftermath and impacts of various frauds. Learning from past cases means you can help protect your clients, employers and the general public from similar schemes in the future. WorldCom In 2002, the WorldCom scandal became one of the largest accounting frauds in history when the company revealed its wrongdoing and was subsequently forced to file bankruptcy and write off $50 billion in losses. The scandal began when WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers employed a business strategy of achieving growth through acquisitions. He acquired MCI Communications and then proposed a merger with Sprint but was forced to abandon the Sprint merger in 2000. Determined to show increased revenue despite a slow-down in mergers and acquisitions, Ebbers manipulated the books to satisfy Wall Street’s expectations. The scheme was detected when a capital expenditures audit revealed suspicious journal entries. WorldCom’s internal audit team discovered improper accounting in expenses over five quarters. The WorldCom accounting scandal was a situation in which corporate governance failed and the board of directors were caught unaware. WorldCom’s accounting system was faulty and Ebbers’ close relationship with external accounting firm Arthur Andersen presented a conflict of interest in which the auditors were unable to exercise professional skepticism when performing their audits. FIFA High-profile sports are big business in many countries. Unfortunately for the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), alleged corruption and money laundering means its big business operated with little or no oversight. The FIFA scandal involved the collusion between FIFA executives, sports marketing executives and officials of continental football bodies. The scandal erupted in May 2015 when Swiss authorities raided a hotel in Zurich and several FIFA executives were arrested. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has cited more than 40 defendants in the FIFA scandal. Some charges involved bids for World Cups and for marketing and broadcast deals that amounted to nearly $150 million. Future World Cups are now in question — the scandal has caused the bidding process for the 2026 World Cup to be suspended. Proposed changes have been made, but only time will tell in an organization that has historically dealt with bribery and corruption. GlaxoSmithKline In 2012, British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was at the center of the largest health care fraud settlement in history when the company agreed to pay $3 billion in fines to U.S. regulators. The crime? According to the U.S. Justice Department, GSK unlawfully promoted certain prescription drugs, failed to report safety data, paid kickbacks to health care professionals and engaged in fraudulent pricing practices. The settlement arose from a number of GSK policies and practices that largely involved the promotion of prescription drugs, like Paxil and Wellbutrin, for off-label use. While doctors may prescribe drugs for off-label use, it’s illegal for pharmaceutical companies to promote or market off-label uses. The U.S. government also claimed that GSK paid unlawful kickbacks to health care professionals to encourage them to prescribe certain drugs. Although much of GSK’s misconduct was unique to the pharmaceutical and health care industries, the case contains broad lessons. A company’s culture should stress compliance and ethical conduct. The nature and prevalence of GSK’s misconduct suggest that its culture rewarded profit rather than compliance and patient safety. That type of culture is a recipe for fraud. Target The Target data breach in late 2013 was the largest in U.S. retail history and resulted in the exposure of approximately 40 million credit card numbers and the personal information of 70 million customers. Unidentified hackers — thought to be from Eastern Europe or Russia — surreptitiously installed malware into Target’s computer networks. The hackers accessed Target’s systems using the credentials of a third-party heating and air conditioning contractor. Before the company was hacked, Target had installed a security system that caught five instances of malware graded at the highest severity. Members of corporate headquarters were notified, but apparently ignored the alerts. In this day and age when cybersecurity has become a hot topic thanks to the increasing advancements in technology, the Target debacle shows that companies need a strong response plan to deal with alerts of possible network intrusions. Olympus The Olympus financial scandal exploded in late 2011 when then president and CEO Michael Woodford came forward with information exposing fraudulent accounting practices in the organization. Woodford had only served as CEO for two weeks when he revealed the financial malfeasance. The fraud is one of the most significant corporate corruption scandals in the history of Japan. In 2000, standards in Japan changed significantly after the failure of Yamaguchi Securities in 1997. The new accounting standards required losses on certain assets to be noted at the end of each accounting period. Rather than comply with the standards and disclose mounting losses, Olympus constructed a complicated system of hiding its bad assets. The company began selling bad assets for exorbitant prices to newly created entities under its control without recognizing losses from the sales. The Olympus fraud shows that tone at the top matters. Woodford wrote letters to the board about his concerns and was subsequently fired. This exemplified the company’s unethical culture. C-level executives must act according to the principles expected of employees at all levels and across the enterprise.
