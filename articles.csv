0,<h1>When Reputation Becomes an Opportunity for Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Dr. Princely Dibia,  Ph.D., CFE, FHEA</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Trusted brands inspire loyalty. But that loyalty can also create the perfect conditions for opportunistic fraud. Worse still, they can become the perfect camouflage for sophisticated fraud. <br/>
<br/>
Consider an organization celebrated for impeccable customer service and top-quality goods. It's a darling of industry awards, a household name and a textbook case study in lean management efficiency. However, behind the scenes, its so-called lean strategy is selectively applied. Controls are piecemeal or siloed; counter fraud and loss prevention policies are vague; and substandard products occasionally “slip through” the value chain.  <br/>
<br/>
In my recent research on fraud risks in a global retail organization practicing lean management, I found that brand trust can serve as both a shield and a sword: a shield against consumer skepticism or suspicion, and a sword for quietly reducing internal vigilance and cutting corners, under the guise of operational excellence or goodwill. In effect, brand trust can inadvertently enable opportunistic fraud, creating vulnerabilities that range from product misrepresentation to elaborate tax scams, often concealed behind a reputational smokescreen. 
<h2>Quality-Washing and Fraud-Washing </h2>
<p>Compared to greenwashing in environmental marketing, two distinct but related patterns emerge in corporate misconduct: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quality-washing:</strong> Presenting a false or exaggerated image of product quality, operational efficiency or lean management commitment. </li>
<li><strong>Fraud-washing:</strong> Misrepresenting counter-fraud, ethics or integrity commitments to shield or downplay harmful practices. </li>
</ol>
<p>In both patterns, claims often involve aspects of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Vague or exaggerated lean or loss prevention messaging, including misleading assertions of efficiency, quality control or defect-free products and delivery. </li>
<li>Selective highlighting of minor improvements or ethics initiatives to overshadow significant defects or risks. </li>
<li>Ethics-signaling imagery and slogans without substantive policy or operational backing. </li>
</ul>
<p>Such tactics lull stakeholders into complacency, enabling substandard goods to be passed off as premium, adulterated products to enter the market or fraudulent activities to be hidden in plain sight. </p>
<h2>Trusted Brands as Reputation Shields  </h2>
<p>Several high-profile cases illustrate how brand prestige can create a cognitive and regulatory blind spot: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toyota’s Sudden Unintended Acceleration:</strong> Concealed safety defects from U.S. regulators, consumers and the public; delayed recalls; and issued misleading statements. Toyota’s lean values and reputation for “zero defects” shielded it until investigations led to a $1.2 billion fine and lasting reputational harm (Austen-Smith et al. 2017; Cole, 2011; Greto et al. 2010; Quelch et al. 2011) </li>
<li><strong>Volkswagen Dieselgate:</strong> Marketed as meeting strict emissions standards while secretly deploying “defeat devices” to cheat regulatory tests (Barth 2022; Ewing, 2017; Hasan et al. 2023). </li>
<li><strong>Food Industry Mislabeling:</strong> Premium “organic” or “pure” goods cut with cheaper substitutes, concealed under strong brand reputations (Agnoli et al. 2016; Barnard and O’Connor 2017; Bitzios 2017; Cox et al. 2020). </li>
<li><strong>Tech Sector Security Claims:</strong> “End-to-end encryption” claims masking partial or flawed implementations (Agnihotri and Bhattacharya 2022; Chaudhri and Yue, 2021; Edelman, 2010; Henry et al. 2021; Segalla and Rouzies 2023). </li>
</ul>
<p>In each example, brand trust acted as a protective layer and delayed detection. While short-term objectives may have included protecting profits or brand equity, eventual exposure caused far greater financial, legal and reputational losses than timely corrective action would have. </p>
<h2>Extension into Corporate Tax Fraud </h2>
<p>Reputation-driven washing behaviors are not confined to consumer-facing operations; they can also intersect with corporate tax crimes.  <br/>
<br/>
Gift aid scams involve fraudulent claims for charitable donations, often routed through reputable foundations, to gain illegitimate tax relief. In this instance, organizations promote corporate social responsibility initiatives (e.g., charity tie-ins) that mask operational shortcomings while leveraging brand trust to validate inflated or falsified donation figures. Enablers in this scam may include the public trust in the brand’s social mission, reliance on symbolic gestures over substantive proof, or satisfaction in compliance checks. <br/>
<br/>
Another example involves eco-investment schemes, when fabricated or exaggerated green projects are marketed to socially conscious investors and stakeholders for tax benefits — with little or no real environmental impact. Organizations market lean or waste-free production claims and narratives, while operations waste resources or mix inferior inputs, selectively publicizing small sustainability wins. An enabler in this scheme can be organizations exploiting consumer demand for ethical/eco products, vague and unverifiable marketing or bounded rationality in leadership prioritizing public and social impact over audit integrity. <br/>
<br/>
In both examples, trusted brand positioning and public perception serve as a cloak for deception and a likely basis for organizations and its decision-makers to rationalize such behaviors, albeit bounded by thinking errors and exploitative. </p>
<h2>Bounded Rationality and Fraud Risk </h2>
<p>According to Herbert Simon’s theory of bounded rationality (Simon, 1979; Simon, 1991; Simon, 1997), decision-makers operate under three major constraints: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Limited information:</strong> They rarely see the full picture. In most organizations, operational leaders rely on curated dashboards, not raw defect data, which may hide underlying irregularities. </li>
<li><strong>Cognitive limitations:</strong> Human brains filter and simplify complex realities. </li>
<li><strong>Time pressures:</strong> Fast decisions can override fully optimal ones. </li>
</ol>
<p>In trusted brand environments, these limits are compounded by cognitive biases such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Halo effect: </strong>“We’ve always been good, so this must be fine.” </li>
<li><strong>Moral licensing: </strong>“We do so much good, a little compromise won’t hurt.” </li>
<li><strong>Availability heuristic:</strong> Recent awards or CSR efforts outweigh ongoing control gaps. </li>
<li><strong>Satisficing:</strong> Settling for ”good enough” lean adoption or compliance that passes casual inspection, rather than following recommended holistic models and achieving full operational integrity. </li>
</ul>
<p>Behavioral psychology literature on contaminated mindware, heuristics and biases details how these shortcuts often feel justified internally, yet they can result in reputationally shielded misconduct. The faulty reasoning patterns may also develop and become embedded in organizational culture, making certain fraud-enabling practices seem normal. </p>
<h2>What Fraud Examiners Should Watch For </h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check substance, not just story:</strong> Counter-fraud claims should have documented policies, cross-departmental reach and measurable enforcement. Scrutiny should be applied on the actual mechanics behind gift aid or eco-investment claims. </li>
<li><strong>Follow the control chain and verify:</strong> Does the organization's lean model apply everywhere or only in showcase processes? Is loss prevention applied only selectively? </li>
<li><strong>Narrative Audit:</strong> Compare marketing claims with operational realities. </li>
<li><strong>Apply forensic analytics:</strong> Monitor for anomalies such as repeated donor identities, inflated valuations or unrealistic ROI projections. </li>
<li><strong>Audit trust-laden spaces:</strong> The more loyal the customer base, the more tempting the environment for undetected deviation. Apply extra scrutiny where brand loyalty is strongest. </li>
<li><strong>Challenge halo-driven assumptions:</strong> High reputation should raise, not lower, investigative curiosity and rigor. </li>
<li><strong>Bias Mapping:</strong> Identify where leadership decision-making reflects satisficing or moral licensing. </li>
</ul>
<p>Trust and reputation are not immunity from fraud risk; they can be enablers for it. For fraud examiners, the task is looking beyond the brand’s narrative to assess whether lean, ethical and green claims are either genuine or a front and opportunity for more elaborate schemes. <br/>

1,<h1>Ghost Fraud: A Haunting Reality</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                When seeing the term “ghost fraud,” your mind might start thinking about the controversial careers of psychics and “ghost whisperers.” While these unorthodox and potentially predatory behaviors towards the bereaved have been around for decades, real ghost frauds are spookier and far more costly. <br/>
<br/>
These insidious fraud schemes have nothing to do with spirits and everything to do with hidden payrolls and hijacked mobile wallets. These frightening schemes are known as ghost employee fraud and ghost tap fraud, and they pose serious risks to businesses across many industries. <br/>
<h2>Ghost Employee Fraud </h2>
Despite the name, a “ghost” employee is not a well-designed bot programmed to scam the system by applying through job boards. Ghost employee fraud is a common form of internal occupational fraud where an employee, typically with payroll access, adds a non-existent employee (the “ghost”) to the company’s payroll. The fraudster then collects the wages and/or benefits that were intended for the phantom employee.  <br/>
<h3>Ghost (Employee) Sighting </h3>
Recently in South Africa, the Johannesburg Commercial Crimes Court sentenced two former employees of the Gauteng Department of Education to prison for carrying out a ghost employee scheme that <a href=""https://iol.co.za/news/crime-and-courts/2025-10-03-r3-million-ghost-employee-fraud-gauteng-education-says-zero-tolerance-for-corruption/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">siphoned off around $175,000 (ZAF 3 million)</a>.  <br/>
<h2>Ghost Tapping Fraud </h2>
While ghost employees haunt the corporate payroll, ghost tapping is the new monster operating in broad daylight. <br/>
<br/>
This scheme involves the fraudster using a mobile device to steal the victim’s card information and loading it onto a mobile wallet without the victim's knowledge. According to research from <a href=""https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/ghost-tapping-chinese-criminal-ecosystem"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Recorded Future</a>’s Insikt Group’, fraudsters use Near Field Communication (NFC) relay tactics to gain access to mobile payment services like Apple Pay or Google Pay. “This technique allows these threat actors to provide mules with stolen payment card details linked to contactless payment systems in person to obtain physical goods, eventually transporting and reselling stolen goods for profit.” <br/>
<h3>Ghost (Tap) Sighting </h3>
In August, a <a href=""https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/570663/woman-accused-of-trying-to-ghost-tap-thousands-of-dollars-worth-of-jewellery"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">25-year-old woman was arrested</a> in Auckland, New Zealand, for using multiple phones to quickly execute the “ghost tapping” operation, making an unauthorized purchase of more than $6,000. This scheme was halted whenever security at a high-end store called the police, right after she unsuccessfully attempted to use multiple phones to carry out this “ghost tapping” scam at a nearby jewelry store.  <br/>
<h2>Avoid Getting Haunted by a Ghost (Fraud) </h2>
<p>Organizations must get ahead of potential ghost employee schemes by preventing them before they happen and implementing stronger internal controls. Here are a few ways to protect your organization from this type of fraud: </p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly review employee records by validating credentials and checking physical addresses.  </li>
<li>Check for payroll abnormalities, such as multiple payments to the same bank account. </li>
<li>Cross-reference payroll with attendance by double-checking that the name on the payroll has verifiable time and attendance records.  </li>
<li>Outsource payroll processing to a third party to add a layer of protection within your internal system. </li>
</ul>
<p>For ghost tapping, fraudsters can steal card information directly from mobile phones by being within a few feet of the victim. This could include walking past the victim, using a card reader while disguised as a legitimate vendor or even by counting on the victim to be inattentive. Here are a few ways to protect yourself and others from falling victim to ghost tapping:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Keep physical cards in RFID-blocking sleeves or wallets to protect them from passive scanning. </li>
<li>Confirm payment details by checking the terminal screen to verify the merchant’s name and the amount before tapping your card in mobile wallet. </li>
<li>Set up transaction alerts to your mobile phone or email to keep track of all transactions, including potential fraudulent transactions.  </li>
<li>Monitor your accounts daily. </li>
<li>Limit contactless use in high-risk areas by exercising caution in crowded or unfamiliar environments.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Host a Fraud Awareness Event  </h2>
Organizing a fraud awareness event at your company or in your community is one of the best ways to engage others. Consider holding a seminar, lunch-and-learn or webinar to discuss common fraud risks, red flags and prevention strategies. You can <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/find-a-cfe"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">invite a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE)</a> to share their insights or use resources available on <a href=""FraudWeek.com"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">FraudWeek.com</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<strong><em>Tip</em></strong><em>: Make the event interactive by allowing employees or participants to ask questions, discuss real-world scenarios or review case studies. The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of how fraud can impact organizations and individuals.  <br/>
</em>
<h2>2. Share Fraud Awareness Content Online  </h2>
Leverage the power of social media by sharing articles, infographics and resources related to fraud prevention. <a href=""FraudWeek.com"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">FraudWeek.com</a> offers free downloadable materials such as social media images, posters and factsheets that you can easily share with your network. Use the official hashtag #FraudWeek to amplify your message and connect with others who are raising awareness.  <br/>
<br/>
<strong><em>Tip</em></strong><em>: Encourage your team or followers to engage by creating polls or discussions around key fraud prevention topics. For example, ask ""What are some red flags you have seen that could indicate fraud?"" to spark conversation and education.  <br/>
</em>
<h2>3. Participate in a Community Event  </h2>
Many local and national organizations <a href=""https://www.fraudweek.com/events"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">host events</a> or initiatives supporting Fraud Week. Check with local ACFE chapters or community groups in your area to see if any fraud awareness walks, charity events or workshops are being organized. You can also team up with other businesses or nonprofits to co-host a public fraud prevention workshop or volunteer at an event dedicated to promoting transparency and ethics.  <br/>
<h2>4. Start an Anti-Fraud Initiative at Work  </h2>
International Fraud Awareness Week is an excellent time to start new anti-fraud initiatives within your workplace. Consider setting up a <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/whistleblower-hotline-report"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">whistleblower hotline</a>, updating your company's fraud risk management policy or launching a fraud awareness training program for employees. These initiatives can help protect your business and employees from fraudulent activity and ensure a proactive approach to fraud prevention.  <br/>
 <br/>
<strong><em>Tip</em></strong><em>: Work with your compliance or internal audit team to review current policies and identify gaps that could be addressed with additional fraud prevention measures.  <br/>
</em>
<h2>5. Educate Yourself and Others  </h2>
The best way to protect yourself and your organization from fraud is by staying informed.

3,<h1>Cybersecurity Awareness Month: How to Protect Sensitive Information Online</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Stefanie Hallgren,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                The threat of cyber fraud continues to prevail online, and it continues ramping up thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Despite this, there are still safety measures you can take to ensure you do not become a victim. <br/>
<br/>
October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, which is a great time to make sure your fraud-fighting skills are primed to stay safe in cyberspace. ACFE Research Director Mason Wilder, CFE, shared insights into cyber fraud and other cybersecurity threats for consumers and organizations, what to know about data breaches and proactive measures you should have in place to protect your financial information online. <br/>
<h2>What are some common cyber fraud threats right now? </h2>
“A lot of the traditionally impactful cyber fraud schemes, like social engineering, phishing and scams, like investment scams, are some of the most prevalent right now,” said Wilder. “They just look a little bit different thanks to enhancement from artificial intelligence tools and technologies that have been made very easily accessible for the general public.” <br/>
<br/>
Wilder shared how cyber fraud schemes are getting more sophisticated and automated thanks to AI. Fraudsters are now able to target even more people at once, and their schemes are becoming more convincing, even if they are from a different country or speak a different language than you. <br/>
<br/>
“[The schemes] would often result in poor language in emails, text messages or phone calls, and that was a red flag,” said Wilder. “But thanks to ChatGPT and other large language models and voice cloning or voice generation technologies, these kinds of red flags are no longer applicable.” <br/>
<br/>
In the coming months to years, Wilder sees many of the same type of scams we are seeing now happening on a larger scale. He noted how digital assets and cryptocurrencies will continue to be exploited, and the instances of romance fraud and impersonation scams will increase. <br/>
<br/>
“I think we will get some different versions of pig butchering,” said Wilder. “Once pig butchering gets to a point where there is enough awareness in the general public about the way those scams work, the attackers are just going to pivot a little bit and come up with a different scam to convince people to hand over their hard-earned money.” <br/>
<h2>How can people protect themselves from cyber fraud? </h2>
“Be skeptical of everything and every digital interaction,” said Wilder. “Every digital interaction carries some cyber fraud risk — even, phone calls, text messages and communications with numbers that you think are your acquaintances or loved ones.” <br/>
<br/>
If you receive a request for money or information, Wilder cautioned that you should verify the request through a trusted channel before sending money or anything else of value. If someone asks you to put money in a crypto ATM, “Stay away from crypto ATMs, period,” Wilder emphasized. “If anybody asks you to go put money in a crypto ATM, that is a humongous red flag. Just do not do it.” <br/>
<h2>What cyber threats are companies facing? </h2>
<p>
Wilder said ransomware remains a concern for most organizations, but cyber threats vary depending on your industry, organization size and many other factors. For instance, financial institutions and financial services businesses are currently combatting synthetic identity fraud, account takeovers and new account frauds from many different avenues. <br/>
<br/>
“People are using AI and deepfakes to either bypass authentication protocols or open new accounts that can receive funds from other illicit activity, including other types of fraud,” Wilder warned. </p>
<p>Other cyber threats that organizations face include: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Social engineering and business e-mail compromise:</strong> “People in organizations that have the ability to authorize wire transfers are at particular risk of being targeted with those types of attacks,” Wilder noted. <br/>
<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Unauthorized access of company or organization networks for fraud-related reasons:</strong> Hackers may try to steal intellectual property or observe employee communications for future impersonations or targeted social engineering schemes. </li>
</ol>
<p>Organizations of all sizes can stay ahead of these threats by putting in place anti-fraud programs or controls. <br/>
<br/>
“The more that you have data about your customers that could be used in fraud schemes, the more at risk you are of suffering a data breach or some kind of account takeovers or unauthorized access that gives the bad guys access to your customers' data that they can put to use in a number of different fraud schemes,” Wilder stressed. </p>
<h2>Data breaches and the power of unique passwords </h2>
Data breaches continue to impact businesses, but does this always spell trouble for their customers?  <br/>
<br/>
“What it means for consumers is that their private information is available to bad guys and that means that they are at an increased risk of identity theft-related fraud,” said Wilder. <br/>
<br/>
This becomes a problem if people reuse usernames and passwords for different online accounts. That is because cyber attackers will try out usernames and passwords on different accounts to access financial information stored in those accounts and use it. <br/>
<br/>
If you suspect you have been a victim of some kind of cyber fraud, or someone may have accessed your information in a data breach, Wilder recommends changing your password immediately and making sure that password is not being used for other accounts. <br/>
<br/>
“On a semi-regular basis, just change passwords to accounts to reduce your vulnerabilities. Do this about a couple times a year or quarterly,” said Wilder. “The longer you keep a password active and the more you use that password across accounts, the higher risk you are facing of being a victim of cyber fraud.” <br/>
<h2>Proactive financial protection </h2>
There are a lot of safety measures you can take ahead of time to make sure your finances remain intact should you fall victim to a cyber scam in the future. <br/>
<h3>Ways You Can Protect Yourself: </h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use a credit card:</strong> Instead of using a debit card for online and other transactions, use credit cards as they have better fraud protection than debit cards. </li>
<li><strong>Explore your payment options:</strong> Many card issuers and banks offer unique options like virtual credit card numbers. “Those are one-time use credit card numbers,” said Wilder. “If you know that information does get intercepted or the retailer that you buy something online from suffers a data breach, then that single use credit card number is of no consequence to you for future use or vulnerabilities.” </li>
<li><strong>Check your accounts regularly:</strong> Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and any payment card accounts you have. Wilder recommends reviewing your bank statements every one to two days to catch any suspicious charges early and report them for a better chance of recovering funds. </li>
<li><strong>Take advice from your financial institutions:</strong> Listening to all advice and guidance from your financial institution, especially when it comes to scams and red flags, is important. “If your bank is reaching out to you saying, ‘Be on the lookout for this scam,’ it's worth taking a couple minutes to read the guidance because they're not sending it for hypothetical reasons,” Wilder shared. “[The financial institutions] are experiencing this and seeing it in their customer accounts and that is why they are warning you. Pay attention to that and just stay cautious and on the lookout.” </li>
<li><strong>Freeze your credit:</strong> Keep your credit frozen most of the time, unless you have specific plans to use it or apply for some new line of credit. This is one tip that Wilder reiterated throughout the conversation. “If you have a credit freeze in place, nobody can take your stolen information and get a new credit card, open up a line of credit with a retailer or apply for a loan in your name,” noted Wilder. “That is a really easy way that you can prevent your credit from being ruined [by] identity theft.” </li>
</ol>

4,"<h1>Racketeering Suit Targets Tallahassee ""Elder Care"" Players</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Brett Darken </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Two dozen “elder care” professionals from the Tallahassee region are named as defendants in a federal civil racketeering (RICO) complaint filed in the Northern District of Florida. </p>
<p>Racketeering, or “RICO” statues, originated in the fight against organized crime and drug cartels. What transforms a simple fraud into a “racket” is when two or more people work together in the commission of the illegal act. </p>
<p>Defendants include local doctors, attorneys and realtors, as well as multiple corporate entities, including FSU SeniorHealth, Cherry Laurel, Holiday By Atria, Inc., Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare and St. Augustine Plantation.  </p>
<p>The plaintiffs are the three daughters of the late Victor Lambou, who are heirs of his estate. The women claim their family’s estate was the target of a theft-by-fraud scheme carried out by the elder care professionals using a “guardianship” that was unwanted and unneeded. <a href=""https://www.stopprobatefraud.com/blog/2025/06/10/florida-rico-case-rooted-in-guardianship/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The suit alleges</a> wire fraud, obstruction, identity fraud, pension embezzlement, witness tampering and healthcare billing fraud.  </p>
<p>Broadly, the suit, which is currently in the discovery phase, claims that rather than protect and serve Mr. Lambou, the “elder care professionals” used their power to target the assets of the retired widower.  </p>
<h2>Trillions at Stake</h2>
<p>About 2.5 million people die each year in the United States, and the “baby boomer” generation are now passing trillions of dollars of their assets to the next generation. If just two percent of these transfers are touched by fraud, it is a $20 billion problem every year.   </p>
<h2>Finance, Law and Civil Rights</h2>
<p>The Florida RICO case, like many cases rooted in probates, trusts and estates, involves multiple components. The Lambou suit has three intersecting components: The Florida legal code; established fiduciary rules and requirements; and civil rights law governing care of the elderly and incapacitated.  </p>
<p>For ACFE members and anti-fraud professionals, fighting fraud in trusts, estates and guardianships is an opportunity to serve, but the cases are complex and challenging because they live at the intersection of law and finance.  </p>
<h2>Finding the Predicate Fraud</h2>
<p>The Florida RICO case is complex: It is 130 pages long and cites more than 400 events that involve more than a dozen defendants. Out of this sea of data, a fraud researcher must find the “predicate fraud,” or the first bad act that “starts the ball rolling.”  </p>
<p>In this suit, the story of the predicate fraud starts on page 33, where it details how plaintiff Geralyn Lambou had moved from out of state to live with and care for her father, Victor, after the death of his wife, Geralyn’s mother.  </p>
<p>The suit states that not only did Geralyn provide in-home care for her father, but she took him to get expert care from Dr. Paul Katz at Florida State University Senior Health. Dr. Katz is the professor and chair of the department of Geriatrics.  <br/>
<br/>
Dr. Katz diagnosed Victor with dementia. He also recommended that Victor live in his home, and advised Geralyn, who already had been given Power of Attorney (POA) by Victor, to take over the management of his finances. Victor and Geralyn complied with Dr. Katz’s recommendations.  <br/>
<br/>
But then the story takes a sharp turn. The complaint details that attorney Twyla Sketchley, who is listed on her website as a veteran elder care attorney, had written Victor’s estate plan and was called by the family for advice on what seemed to be a trivial matter: Mr. Lambou’s longtime housekeeper was suspected of stealing from him.  </p>
<p>The suit claims that Sketchley teamed up with defendants Howard Kessler, M.D., and Dr. Kessler’s wife, Ann Van Meter. Together, they allegedly advised Victor to reject the advice of Dr. Katz and told the elderly dementia patient that he should move out of his house to avoid firing the housekeeper. Victor followed the advice of Sketchley and Dr. Kessler. The defendants then coordinated Victor’s move out of his home to an elder-care facility. </p>
<p>The complaint then reveals the first alleged fraud in the timeline: During this time, Sketchley used her status (as an officer of the court) to contact Victor’s post office and had Victor’s mail redirected to the home of Van Meter and Dr. Kessler. The suit states that Sketchley did not get permission from either Victor or Geralyn to change his mailing information, nor had Kessler and Van Meter been authorized by Victor to receive Victor’s mail. The suit states that Victor didn’t even know that Sketchley, Kessler and Van Meter had re-routed his mail. </p>
<p>But the fraud that triggered thefts of Victor’s assets — the predicate fraud — is detailed on page 36: The suit states that in October 2019, Sketchley had Victor Lambou sign multiple legal documents that changed his estate plan — even though the attorney knew that Victor had been diagnosed with dementia.  </p>
<p>The suit accuses Sketchley of having “Victor sign a Petition for a Voluntary Guardianship over his property, requesting the appointment of Attorney Leonard Helfand (a defendant) as Guardian of Property, revocation of DPOA, and has Victor sign an amendment to his Trust appointing (Ann) Van Meter as his Successor Trustee and Helfand in the alternative.” </p>
<h2>Florida Code Defines the Fraud</h2>
<p>Florida statutes broadly direct elder care professionals to use the “least restrictive means” to assist individuals, such as durable powers of attorney, trusts or supported decision-making.  <br/>
<br/>
The Florida legislature wants guardianship to be a “last resort.” The suit claims the defendants did exactly the opposite of what Florida’s law directs. It accuses the defendants of violating Florida Statute 744.341, which details that “voluntary guardianship” is when “a mentally competent adult, who is physically incapable of managing their property or financial affairs (often due to age or physical condition), voluntarily petitions the court to appoint a guardian to manage their estate.” <br/>
<br/>
The suit claims the defendants knew that Victor Lambou suffered from dementia and lacked the capacity to enter into a contractual agreement. Additionally, defendants knew that as a dementia patient, Victor did not qualify for the voluntary guardianship agreement they allegedly lured him into signing.  <br/>
<br/>
The RICO complaint details in length how the defendants, having led a dementia patient to changing his legal documents, then allegedly used those documents to exploit their court authority and deplete Victor’s life savings. The man who thought he was a client was in fact a target. </p>
<p>This case offers fresh insights into the creative ways that fraud operators target their victims. With more than two million new probates being opened every year in the U.S., there are many opportunities for ACFE members to bring clarity into chaotic circumstances.  </p>

5,<h1>Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship Recipient: Darwin Makhija</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Driven by an early passion for uncovering financial crime and a commitment to integrity, Darwin Makhija has built an impressive academic and professional record of high achievements. As the first Indian recipient of the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship, Darwin shares how the scholarship has accelerated his work in the fight against fraud. </p>
<h2>How did you hear about the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship and what made you decide to apply? </h2>
I first learned about the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship through the ACFE’s official channels a few months before the application cycle. At that point, I was already deeply involved in forensic accounting and anti-money laundering (AML) research, having authored two internationally published books and contributed to various academic projects. The scholarship immediately resonated with me because its values — integrity, professionalism and advancing the fight against fraud — mirrored my own journey. I saw it as an opportunity not just for financial support, but as a platform to give global recognition to my work and reaffirm my commitment to the anti-fraud community. <br/>
<br/>
Another motivating factor was the fact that no Indian had ever received this honor before. While that initially felt intimidating, it also inspired me to represent my country in this global space. I wanted to show that contributions from developing countries like India are equally impactful in shaping the fight against financial crime. For me, applying was less about competing and more about stepping into a community where my passion, hard work and contributions could be recognized and amplified. <br/>
<h2>How did you become passionate about fighting fraud? </h2>
My passion for fighting fraud began with a realization during my early academic years in India:  Fraud is not just about numbers or transactions, it impacts real people, trust in institutions and even the pace of national development. While many of my peers pursued traditional careers in commerce or accountancy, I was drawn to the investigative and analytical nature of forensic accounting. Enrolling in India’s first integrated MBA program in forensic accounting and fraud investigation gave me the foundation to follow this calling, and from there my journey only deepened. <br/>
<br/>
Hands-on experiences fueled my passion even further. At Prudent Insurance, I investigated cyber frauds and high-value claims, which taught me how financial crimes exploit loopholes. At Precisa, I worked directly on forensic bank statement analysis, unearthing layering and money laundering patterns. And at Karmine, I refined skills in money mule profiling and source of wealth identification. These experiences, combined with authoring two books and engaging with global experts, transformed my interest into a mission: to dedicate my career to unmasking deceit and strengthening financial integrity worldwide. 
<h2>What advice do you have for students who are interested in applying for the scholarship? </h2>
My advice would be to approach the application with both confidence and authenticity. This scholarship is about much more than financial aid— it’s about showing your commitment to the profession and how you have contributed to advancing the fight against fraud. When I applied, I carried doubts, especially because no Indian had ever been awarded before me. But I chose to highlight my academic dedication, internships and contributions to the anti-fraud field. That authenticity and passion ultimately made a difference. <br/>
<br/>
For students applying, I would also encourage you to engage deeply with the ACFE community. Attend webinars, join local or student chapters and seek mentorship from professionals in the field. These not only enrich your application but also give you experiences and networks that will serve you for years to come. The Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship can be a career-defining moment; it certainly was for me. It opened doors to recognition at my university, my country’s ACFE chapter and even in international circles. If you are passionate about fraud prevention, don’t hold back. Apply wholeheartedly and let your journey speak for itself. <br/>

6,"<h1>Ways to Combat Trending Text Scams: Fake Deliveries, Job Offers and Toll Tags</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Scam text messages, also known as “smishing,” are not a new threat, but they have evolved into many forms over the years. With technology giving scammers a bigger platform to grow, consumers and organizations need to stay one step ahead of trending scams. <br/>
Among the most unique scams taking place through text messages are fake delivery notices, fraudulent job offers and toll tag scams.  
<h2>Is the “USPS Package on Hold” Text a Scam? </h2>
<p>Delivery texts often appear to be from services such as USPS or UPS. They try to trick victims into clicking malicious links under the guise of tracking a package or problems with their account. According to the <a href=""https://faq.usps.com/s/article/Scams-Scheme-Alerts"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">USPS</a>, common phrases that fraudsters will use in a fraudulent delivery text message include: </p>
<ul>
<li>“Your account has been suspended.”  </li>
<li>“There is a suspicious activity on your account.”  </li>
<li>“There is a problem with your shipping address.”  </li>
<li><a href=""https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/a-fake-delivery-text-nearly-cost-deshawn-hundreds-his-scam-story/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">“There is a package waiting for you at the post office.”</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href=""https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/12/fake-shipping-notification-emails-text-messages-what-you-need-know-holiday-season"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a> also adds that these fraudulent texts could be saying something along the lines of missing a delivery attempt and needing to reschedule the delivery or that your item is ready to ship but your shipping preferences need to be updated.  <br/>
<br/>
Malicious links within those texts will either lead to a fake website masquerading as a real site or could install malware on your phone. Fake sites within those links will <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/how-identify-and-avoid-package-delivery-scams"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">request personal and security</a> information from you, but other links could lead victims to download malicious apps and expose them to malware.  <br/>
<br/>
If you believe you received a fake text regarding deliveries, avoid clicking the link within the text. Instead, look up the specific delivery service’s website to check if the text you received was legitimate or a scam. If you confirm that you received a scam text regarding your delivery, report it on the <a href=""https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/?orgcode=USPS"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">FTC website</a> or forward it to <a href=""mailto: spam@uspis.gov"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">spam@uspis.gov</a> if they are fraudulently claiming to be USPS. </p>
<h2>How Can I Tell a Job Offer Text is Real? </h2>
<p>On the hunt for a new job? Accepting a position from an unsolicited text message may not be the way to go. Job offer scam texts <a href=""https://www.wxyz.com/news/i-lost-a-lot-of-money-troy-man-loses-thousands-in-recent-job-scam"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">lure individuals</a> with the promise of a job opportunity, baiting them to click a fraudulent link to steal personal and security information from them.  <br/>
<br/>
With online job board websites being the primary focus for job seekers, the likelihood your information from those sites getting leaked and being used by fraudsters is increasing. According to reports on FTC data, job opportunity text scams have skyrocketed, with reported losses estimated at $2 million in 2020 and rising to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/23/why-scam-job-offers-keep-hitting-your-phone.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">$61.2 million in 2024</a>.  <br/>
<br/>
Fraudsters pose as recruiters who “found” you on Indeed, LinkedIn and other job board sites to legitimize their messages and increase trust. Before responding to that job opportunity or clicking the link, use caution by double checking the company’s website to see if the offer is real. If you can find the job posting, proceed with skepticism by reaching out directly to the recruiter listed for that role.  <br/>
<br/>
If you receive a scam message on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1336387"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=""https://support.indeed.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040122551-Reporting-a-Message-or-Phishing-Attempt"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Indeed </a>or another job recruiting site, report it to them immediately. If you receive a job-related scam text message to your personal phone number, report it on the <a href=""https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/?orgcode=USPS"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">FTC website</a>.  </p>
<h2>Do Toll Agencies Send Payment Notices by Text? </h2>
<p>Toll tag scam texts attempt to trick victims by making them think they need to settle a toll road bill as soon as possible to avoid facing bigger consequences. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), they receive consumer complaints about fraudulent text messages claiming to be toll companies such as E-ZPass, FasTrak and I-PASS. These texts tend to follow a pattern of claiming that the recipient has a past due toll payment or a balance on their account. They normally follow up with encouragement to take action to avoid immediate suspension of the recipient’s account. While legitimate toll agencies may send text or email alerts, users must be opted in through their account to receive these notices.</p>
<h2>Red Flags to Look Out For </h2>
<ul>
<li>Receiving unsolicited messages about <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=warning-signs-package-delivery-scams"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">package deliveries</a>. Shipping companies typically only send notifications if you have opted in through their official channels. </li>
<li>URLs that mimic legitimate company websites but with slight variations. </li>
<li>Requesting personal information such as social security numbers, credit card details or passwords. </li>
<li>Urgent or threatening phrases such as stating that a failure to respond or act immediately will result in consequences.</li>
<li>Unexpected payment requests for fees, charges or taxes.</li>
<li>The text messages are being sent through an international number. </li>
<li>Requesting payment through non-traditional payment methods, such as <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-governmental-affairs/how-spot-and-avoid-toll-road-payment-scam-texts"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">gift cards or wire transfers</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h2>What to Do If You Clicked a Scam Text</h2>
<p>Sometimes we do not realize a message could be a scam before it’s too late, here are steps you can take to mitigate risk if you engaged with a scam text message: </p>
<ol>
<li>Close the site and clear your cookies. </li>
<li>Run a security scan on your device and make sure your device’s security software is up to date. </li>
<li>Change any passwords on accounts you logged into and enable multi-factor authentication. </li>
<li>Contact your bank or credit card company if you shared any financial information. </li>
<li>Consider placing a credit freeze or fraud alert if you provided personal information. </li>
<li>Keep a record of the incident, save any screenshots of the text and details of what happened in case you need to refer to it in the future. </li>
<li>Report the incident to the relevant authorities and the organization being impersonated. </li>
</ol>
<p>To avoid falling victim to these scams, do not use the link to access your account from the text. Instead, look up your account directly on your toll agencies website to check your payments and balances. If you receive one of these messages, you can report it on the <a href=""https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/?orgcode=USPS"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">FTC’s website</a>, the <a href=""https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">FCC’s complaint page</a> or through your toll agency’s website. </p>

7,<h1>Strengthening Public-Sector Fraud Defense</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Fraud in government programs undermines more than budgets. It erodes public trust, impacts services and weakens institutions designed to protect citizens. Taxpayer-funded programs, social services and government institutions are prime targets for fraudsters looking to exploit systemic gaps.  <br/>
<br/>
According to data of actual fraud cases compiled in the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ (ACFE’s) Occupational Fraud 2024: A Report to the Nations, organizations in the government and public administration sector faced a median loss of $200,000 per case of occupational fraud, with an average loss of $2,451,000 per case. As fraud threats evolve, government and law enforcement agencies must adapt quickly to protect resources and maintain public confidence. <br/>
<br/>
The ACFE <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/lega"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Law Enforcement and Government Alliance (LEGA)</a> program is designed to fill this gap for government agencies at the local, state, national and international levels, providing anti-fraud training and resources to assist and guide you in your efforts to prevent, deter and reduce fraud. <br/>
<h2>A Collective Defense Against Fraud </h2>
<p>
Fraud against government programs continues to grow in scope and sophistication. From pandemic relief fraud to benefits fraud and emerging tech schemes, fraudsters continue to find new ways to exploit vulnerabilities across the public sector. <br/>
<br/>
Unlike in the private sector where profit margins may be able to absorb some of these losses, fraud in government programs directly impacts citizens. From delayed services to diminished public resources, the consequences are immediate and visible. This makes the role of public-sector fraud examiners, auditors and investigators even more critical to support. </p>
<blockquote class=""text-color-option""><q>The Internal Revenue Service’s Office of Fraud Enforcement (OFE) is proud to have numerous Certified Fraud Examiners as part of their organization. The CFE credential ensures employees are properly trained in the latest fraud issues and techniques. … OFE’s partnership with LEGA provides excellent networking opportunities for all of OFE’s CFE members.</q></blockquote>

8,<h1>Catching What Prevention Misses: The Case for Detective Controls</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Min Peng,  CFE, CIA, CPA</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Fraud remains a pervasive and costly risk affecting organizations across all industries and sizes. While most businesses prioritize preventative controls aimed at stopping fraud before it happens, they often underestimate the importance of detective controls. Relying solely on preventative measures and internal audits creates blind spots that can allow fraud to go unnoticed, ultimately exposing organizations to significant financial and reputational damage. This article explores why detective controls are indispensable and how organizations can effectively integrate them into their fraud risk management strategies. <br/>
<h2>The Gap in Business-Level Controls </h2>
<p>Many organizations invest considerable resources in preventative controls, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Segregation of duties</strong> to prevent conflicts of interest and unauthorized transactions. </li>
<li><strong>Access controls</strong> limiting system and data access to authorized personnel. </li>
<li><strong>Employee training</strong> promoting ethical conduct and fraud awareness. </li>
<li><strong>Vendor and customer due diligence</strong> to reduce exposure to external fraud risks. </li>
</ul>
<p>While these controls are vital, they only address part of the fraud risk landscape. Fraudsters, particularly those with insider access, can find ways to bypass preventative controls through collusion or exploiting control weaknesses.  Without strong detective controls built into daily operations, these schemes can persist unnoticed. </p>
<h2>Why Detective Controls Matter </h2>
<p>Detective controls act as a vital second line of defense, providing ongoing monitoring and validation of preventative efforts. Examples of these controls include: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Routine reconciliations</strong>, such as matching bank statements with ledger entries to detect anomalies. </li>
<li><strong>Management reviews and variance analysis</strong> that highlight unusual trends or unexpected fluctuations in data. </li>
<li><strong>Automated monitoring tools</strong> with exception reporting capabilities to flag transactions outside normal parameters. </li>
<li><strong>Surprise audits and operational spot checks</strong> that test adherence to policies and uncover irregularities. </li>
</ul>
<p>These controls provide timely feedback, enabling organizations to detect fraud earlier and respond promptly to mitigate losses. </p>
<h2>Technology’s Role in Detection </h2>
<p>Advances in technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics, have revolutionized detective controls. Continuous transaction monitoring powered by AI can identify complex fraud patterns that traditional controls might miss. For instance, machine learning algorithms analyze millions of transactions in real time, flagging those that deviate from established behavior patterns. These tools not only improve detection speed but also reduce manual workload and human error. </p>
<h2>Challenges in Implementing Detective Controls </h2>
<p>Despite their importance, many organizations struggle to implement detective controls effectively due to: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource constraints</strong>, especially in smaller organizations lacking dedicated fraud teams. </li>
<li><strong>Resistance to change</strong>, as embedding detective controls often requires modifying existing processes. </li>
<li><strong>Skill gaps</strong> among staff who may not be trained to identify fraud indicators during routine activities. </li>
<li><strong>Overreliance on internal audits</strong>, which are periodic and cannot provide continuous detection. </li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing these challenges requires leadership commitment, appropriate training and investment in tools that facilitate detection. </p>
<h2>Best Practices for Closing the Gap </h2>
<p>To strengthen fraud risk management and fill the business-level detective control gap, organizations should: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Embed detective controls into daily operations:</strong> Integrate reconciliations, exception reporting and management reviews as routine tasks performed by business units, rather than treating them as audit functions. </li>
<li><strong>Establish feedback loops:</strong> Use findings from detective controls to continuously improve and adapt preventative measures. </li>
<li><strong>Assign clear accountability:</strong> Make business unit leaders responsible for both preventative and detective controls, fostering a culture of ownership. </li>
<li><strong>Invest in staff training:</strong> Educate employees on recognizing fraud red flags and encourage reporting suspicious activities without fear of retaliation. </li>
<li><strong>Leverage technology:</strong> Adopt AI-powered monitoring and data analytics tools to enhance detection capabilities. </li>
<li><strong>Coordinate with internal audit:</strong> Ensure internal audits focus on testing the effectiveness of both preventative and detective controls, creating synergy rather than overlap. </li>
</ol>
<p>Detective controls are not merely a supplementary component but a critical pillar of a robust fraud risk management framework. By recognizing the limitations of preventative controls alone and embedding effective detective measures, organizations can quickly detect fraud, reduce losses and protect their reputation.  <br/>
<br/>
The evolving fraud landscape demands continuous vigilance and adaptation, making detective controls indispensable for sustainable organizational resilience. </p>

9,<h1>Future-Proofing Fraud Prevention: The Role of Corporate Alliances in Emerging Threats</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                The nature of fraud has changed significantly throughout the past few years. The present environment has led to unexpected and rapid threats, with new technologies, changing regulations and global uncertainty. <br/>
<br/>
No organization can prepare for every threat alone. That is why collaboration is a key part of modern fraud prevention. <br/>
<h2>A Smarter Way to Tackle Shared Risks </h2>
Fraud does not affect every organization the same way. For example, while corruption is prevalent in almost all industries, those in the banking and financial services industry experience more cash on hand loss compared to the technology industry, which grapples with noncash fraud at a higher rate, according to <em><a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Occupational Fraud 2024: A Report to the Nations</a></em>. <br/>
<br/>
Some organizations encounter phishing and identity fraud. Others focus on detecting internal misconduct or cleaning up vendor data. But most ask similar questions: What are we missing? How do we stay ahead of what is coming next? <br/>
<br/>
The <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/membership/group-membership-and-partnership/corporate-alliance?utm_source=acfeinsights&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=20258-CorporateAllianceProgram"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ACFE Corporate Alliance</a> program helps to answer these questions by creating a space for member organizations to share knowledge and benchmarking tools alongside a global network of anti-fraud professionals. The partnership program enables organizations to learn from peers, which enhances internal capabilities while developing fraud prevention strategies that remain effective through changing risk environments. <br/>
<h2>Staying Prepared in a Changing World </h2>
The evolution of generative artificial intelligence (AI), together with synthetic identities and sophisticated social engineering methods, means fraud schemes are becoming increasingly difficult to recognize. The decentralization of business operations and increased digitization of work creates new vulnerabilities that fraudsters are constantly evolving their methods to exploit. <br/>
<br/>

10,<h1>When Lean Controls Are Not Enough: Rethinking Refund Fraud Prevention</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Dr. Princely Dibia,  Ph.D., CFE, FHEA</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Lean management systems have traditionally relied on the technical optimization of processes, streamlining operations, eliminating waste and embedding control mechanisms directly into workflows. This emphasis is visible in counter-fraud measures such as standardized refund policies, automated transaction logs and visual signage. However, evidence from an empirical study of a global retail organization practicing lean management, especially in relation to fraudulent refund claims, reveals that these controls, while efficient, can be circumvented, rationalized or ignored due to social and cultural dynamics within the organization. <br/>
<h2>Technical Strength and Fraud Control Limits </h2>
<p>Lean environments typically embed controls using visual systems (e.g., signage, alerts), structured flows (e.g., FIFO processing) and efficiency measures. In the organization studied: </p>
<ul>
<li>Refund claims were logged and standardized. </li>
<li>A ""No Receipt, No Refund"" policy was enforced at the point of sale. </li>
<li>Signage was placed at payment desks to visually reinforce this policy. </li>
</ul>
<p>These measures yielded some technical success, especially when signage was made more visible and consistent across stores. However, employees and managers noted that fraudulent refund claims continued to occur, often under familiar pretexts: misplaced receipts, duplicate items or confusion during busy hours. </p>
<h2>Structuration Theory: Why Structure Alone Does Not Stop Fraud </h2>
<p>
Critically, the policy’s effectiveness was not simply a function of visibility, but of how it was interpreted, enforced and navigated by both customers and staff. This is where structuration theory becomes vital. <br/>
<br/>
According to Giddens' ""The Constitution of Society"", structures (rules, policies, norms) both constrain and enable human action. They are sustained, or altered, through everyday behavior. In the case study: </p>
<ul>
<li>Some employees sympathized with customers and bent the refund rules, drawing on social norms of leniency or in response to customer service pressure. </li>
<li>Others reported a lack of clarity on when to enforce rules strictly a reflection of weak agency embedded in ambiguous structures. </li>
<li>Some store teams developed tacit workarounds to avoid confrontation, effectively undermining the visual control policy. </li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the same technical control (e.g., the refund policy and signage) was interpreted and enacted differently based on individual judgment, peer influence, leadership expectations and perceived consequences. <br/>
<br/>
Structuration theory thus explains a key insight from the study: fraudulent refund claims persisted not because controls were absent, but because the social structures enabling staff behavior were inconsistent or contradictory. </p>
<h2>Joint-Optimization: Towards a More Balanced Lean Fraud Strategy </h2>
<p>
The research study reinforces the idea that fraud controls in lean environments must do more than enforce rules. To truly be effective, they must be jointly optimized across technical and social dimensions.  </p>
<p>
Socio-technical systems theory encourages designing processes that treat technology and people as interdependent parts of one system. In fact, the theory recommends: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing systems that consider people integral to control outcomes. </li>
<li>Co-producing rules with staff to ensure clarity and legitimacy. </li>
<li>Balancing control policies with professional judgment, avoiding rigid automation that removes discretion without support. </li>
</ul>
<p>Examples drawn from the case study include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing employee training on why refund fraud harms the organization and customers, not just how to enforce policy. </li>
<li>Using feedback loops from frontline staff to refine signage placement, language and visibility in ways that resonate with local store contexts. </li>
<li>Integrating customer-facing transparency tools, such as printed policies on receipts or digital displays that explain anti-fraud measures in customer-centered language; shifting culture from ""compliance"" to ""shared responsibility."" </li>
</ul>
<h2>The “Condemnation of the Condemners” in Refund Fraud Culture </h2>
<p>Neutralization theory adds further insight. One of its key tactics, ""condemnation of the condemners,"" was observed in the study. Staff and even some managers rationalized leniency by criticizing: </p>
<ul>
<li>Leadership priorities: “They only care about sales, not fraud.” </li>
<li>Policy inconsistency: “Corporate changes refund rules all the time.” </li>
<li>Customer expectations: “They will go elsewhere if we do not refund.” </li>
</ul>
<p>This discursive distancing disempowered staff from acting as effective fraud gatekeepers, despite having the technical tools. The result: technical systems were present, but agency was neutralized. <br/>
<br/>
Structuration theory helps us see that combating fraud involves shaping not just systems, but also social discourse and normative alignment. In other words, it is not enough to write a policy or design a workflow, we must shape the narratives and values that guide real-world practice. </p>
<h2>A Structurally Intelligent Approach to Lean Fraud Management </h2>
<p>Fraud in lean organizations is not just a deviation from technical systems. It is a structurally embedded issue, emerging from the interplay of control systems, workplace norms and human agency.  <br/>
<br/>
The research findings highlight three takeaways for practitioners: </p>
<ul>
<li>Jointly optimize technical and social systems, aligning lean control tools with culturally embedded agency. Lean fraud controls are most effective when designed for both system efficiency and human alignment. </li>
<li>Engage staff in rule creation and enforcement, building legitimacy and reducing moral disengagement. A policy is only as strong as the interpretation and action it inspires in those who apply it. </li>
<li>Visualize accountability not only through dashboards, but through shared narratives of purpose and fairness. Cultural scripts that justify fraud or non-enforcement must be openly discussed and dismantled. </li>
</ul>
<p>In truth, lean thinking supports this approach. Its roots in continuous improvement, problem visibility and respect for people call for a return to joint-optimization, which aligns perfectly with the idea of structurally intelligent fraud prevention. <br/>
<br/>
However, it is only by embracing both structure and agency, rules and relationships, that organizations can sustainably manage fraud risk in lean environments. By rebalancing technical rigor with social understanding, we detect fraud more effectively and build systems that are resilient, adaptable and fair. </p>

12,<h1>10 Red Flags That Exposed a Troubled EPC Company</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Sumitra Raghavan,  MBA, CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                In the world of engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), financial complexity is expected — but not at the cost of accountability. A recent forensic investigation into an EPC company reveals a tangled web of irregular transactions, liquidity crises, compliance failures and audit red flags. Conducted by a joint investigation and forensic audit team, this case presents a critical study in early warning signs, oversight breakdowns and how financial engineering can mask operational distress. <br/>
<h2>Uncovering the Red Flags </h2>
The investigation began when recurring abnormal transactions and financial inconsistencies were reported in the company’s accounts. A detailed forensic review revealed a series of systemic and strategic failures: <br/>
<h3>1. Debt Servicing Failures </h3>
The company failed to meet its obligations on non-convertible debentures even after investors exercised the put option. Interest on cash credit facilities was routinely delayed, signaling deep liquidity issues. <br/>
<h3>2. Stressed Liquidity </h3>
The company’s cash flow was under severe strain. A majority of its cash accruals were tied up in receivables, with recovery timelines uncertain. Asset monetization was also pending, posing a serious operational risk. <br/>
<h3>3. Mismanagement of Financial Instruments </h3>
Multiple bank guarantees and letters of credit had been invoked or devolved, yet no proper regularization had taken place. This reflected both procedural lapses and weak financial governance. <br/>
<h3>4. Audit Qualifications and Control Weaknesses </h3>
<p>Joint statutory auditors raised significant concerns, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Inadequate evaluation of recoverability for long-outstanding balances, including unbilled revenues, trade receivables, loans and project site inventories. </li>
<li>Improper provisioning for credit-impaired assets and flawed fair value assessments. </li>
<li>Misclassification of several non-current assets (including trade receivables and arbitration-related balances) worth $3.5 billion as current assets. </li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Statutory Non-Compliance </h3>
<p>The company had accumulated: </p>
<ul>
<li>Unpaid statutory dues totaling $39.78 billion. </li>
<li>Undeposited Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) of $88.16 million, with delays ranging from 6 to 8 months. </li>
<li>Non-deposited provident fund dues of $55.56 billion.  </li>
</ul>
<p>These not only attract penal consequences but raise serious red flags for regulatory non-compliance. </p>
<h3>6. Accounting Irregularities </h3>
<p>Deferred receivables of $54 million were misclassified as current assets. Further, non-current assets worth $120 million were incorrectly reported under term liabilities, violating fundamental accounting principles. </p>
<h3>7. Supplier Advance and Receivable Risks </h3>
<p>$70 million in advances to suppliers appeared unrecoverable with no provisions made. Similar issues were observed with disputed receivables and cases where materials were not received despite advance payments. </p>
<h3>8. High Leverage and Cost of Capital </h3>
<p>The company's interest coverage ratio hovered at 1.20, indicating an inability to generate sufficient profits to cover debt obligations. Inter-corporate deposits (ICDs) were serviced at interest rates as high as 12–15%, significantly impairing profitability. Alarmingly, some ICD repayments (totaling $55.67 million) were made without lender consent. </p>
<h3>9. Legal Exposure </h3>
<p>The company was embroiled in a large number of litigations — both as plaintiff and defendant. These ranged from supplier disputes to project overruns and delays in site handovers. No provisions were made for cost overruns, despite their material impact on ongoing projects. </p>
<h3>10. Investments Outside Core Operations </h3>
<p>Funds amounting to $114.56 million were invested in subsidiaries, joint ventures and mutual funds, even as the parent company struggled with cash flows. These investments were not liquidated or reallocated, despite clear financial stress. </p>
<h2>Key Takeaways for Fraud Examiners and Auditors </h2>
<p>This case provides valuable insight into the systemic issues that can plague large-scale EPC operations and the importance of forensic scrutiny in uncovering them: </p>
<h3>Adopt a Risk-Based, Objective Approach </h3>
<p>Tailor forensic audits to the unique risks of the industry. EPC companies are capital-intensive, contract-driven and highly reliant on receivables — requiring industry-specific red flag identification. </p>
<h3>Use Public Domain Checks Strategically </h3>
<p>Background checks on related entities, vendor affiliations and directors can uncover concealed relationships and undisclosed risks. </p>
<h3>Prioritize Transaction Testing </h3>
<p>Detailed transaction mapping helps trace fund flows, identify potential round-tripping and spot misuse of company funds. </p>
<h3>Study Financial Statements Deeply </h3>
<p>Annual reports, audit qualifications and management discussion sections often contain subtle yet revealing red flags. Disclosures around contingent liabilities, receivables aging and asset provisioning can be particularly instructive. <br/>
<br/>
Forensic investigations are not just about identifying what went wrong — they are about understanding why it went wrong and how to prevent recurrence. In this EPC company’s case, weak internal controls, poor cash management and regulatory non-compliance created a perfect storm. For anti-fraud professionals, this is a stark reminder: early red flags, if ignored, can evolve into full-blown corporate crises. </p>

13,<h1>6 High-Profile Fraud Cases of the Last 6 Months</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>The first six months of 2025 were filled with several high-profile fraud cases, from discoveries to charges and convictions. With fraud cases continuing to dominate headlines and fraudsters using new technology to exploit vulnerabilities, here are six fraud cases that encapsulated the first half of the year. </p>
<h2>1. Former Finance Minister of Mozambique Sentenced for $2 Billion in Fraud Schemes  </h2>
<h4>Source: <a href=""https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/former-finance-minister-mozambique-sentenced-2b-fraud-schemes"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">NASDAQ </a>| January 20, 2025 </h4>
<p>
Manuel Chang, the former Finance Minister of Mozambique, faces more than eight years in prison after a U.S. court sentenced him to 102 months in prison for his role in one of Africa’s largest corruption scandals. The former finance minister’s illicit activities came to light after investigators uncovered how he abused his government position to facilitate a $2 billion fraud scheme involving investors. This specific case required international cooperation between South Africa, the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Spain and Portugal, all contributing to the case against Chang. Between 2013 and 2015, the former finance minister turned a legitimate maritime development project into a personal enrichment opportunity, pocketing $7 million in bribes and diverting more than $200 million in loan proceeds. </p>
<p>
Following sentencing, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent S. Wible, head of the Justice Departments’ Criminal Division, said, “Chang’s brazen misconduct betrayed his duty to the people of Mozambique and defrauded investors, including those in the United States, of substantial amounts. With today’s sentence, Chang has been held accountable for his violations of U.S. law.”

<h2>2. Two Estonian Nationals Plead Guilty in $577M Cryptocurrency Fraud Scheme </h2>

<p>
For approximately four years, Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin made more than $577 million through their cryptocurrency mining operation, “Hashflare.” Their company attracted hundreds of thousands of customers who believed they were investing in a legitimate cryptocurrency operation. In reality, the two 40-year-old Estonian nationals were running a massive Ponzi scheme defrauding victims. Rather than operating the massive computing infrastructure needed for crypto mining, Potapenko and Turogin created fake data to populate their customer dashboard while using new investor funds to pay earlier participants. They then used those illicit proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle by purchasing luxury vehicles and real estate, maintaining that they were running a successful and legitimate operation.  </p>
<p>
As part of their guilty pleas, both Potapenko and Turogin agreed to forfeit more than $400 million in assets to compensate the victims of their scheme. In addition to their financial obligation, they also face up to 20 years in prison.  
</p>
<h2>3. Rapper Sean Kingston and His Mother Found Guilty of Wire Fraud </h2>
<h4>Source: <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rapper-sean-kingston-mother-guilty-fraud-rcna198674"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">NBC News</a> | March 28, 2025 </h4>
<p>
Sean Kingston, the artist behind the hit song “Beautiful Girls,” and his mother, Janice Turner, were convicted in a Fort Lauderdale court of defrauding luxury retailers. The musician used his fame and social media influence to convince high-end businesses to deliver expensive goods before receiving payment. After receiving the goods, Kingston would send fraudulent wire transfers, leaving retailers without legitimate money. For her role in this scheme, Turner handled the logistics and follow-up communications to ensure the deliveries were completed before companies could discover the nature of their scheme. </p>
<p>
This illicit activity targeted jewelry companies, luxury bed businesses, exotic car dealers and electronics retailers. Turner’s defense argued that she was attempting to protect her son from people “after his money"", with her defense team stating that, “This case is about a woman’s intuition.” The jury delivered the conviction after only three and a half hours of deliberation. While awaiting sentencing, Kingston was allowed house arrest. Turner was taken immediately into custody after the judge determined that her testimony indicated possible obstruction of justice.

<h2>4. Credit Suisse Confesses to Tax Fraud, Faces $510M Fine </h2>
<h4>Source: <a href=""https://www.banking-gateway.com/news/credit-suisse-tax-fraud-fine/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Future Banking</a> | May 6, 2025 </h4>
<p>
Credit Suisse, one of Switzerland’s largest financial institutions, admitted to tax fraud by helping their American clients hide more than $4 billion from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Credit Suisse entered a guilty plea, admitting to the fraud and agreeing to pay out $510 million in penalties. </p>
<p>
The bank had operated for more than a decade on an elaborate system designed to help wealthy clients evade their taxes in concealed offshore accounts. Credit Suisse employees helped American clients fill out false documentation to maintain the illusion of compliance while violating U.S. tax laws, with at least 475 undeclared accounts containing billions in assets. In addition to the trouble that they were already in, UBS, the company that acquired Credit Suisse’s Singapore operations in 2023, found and reported additional undeclared accounts to the United States Justice Department during the merger and has cooperated during the ensuing investigations.  
</p>
<h2>5. More Than 300 Charged in $14.6 Billion Health Care Fraud Schemes Takedown </h2>
<h4>Source: <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-health-care-fraud-schemes-6a3e11dc1827dfd20ec8ea04b7c7ce9a"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">AP News</a> | June 30, 2025 </h4>
<p>
As part of the “largest coordinated takedown of health care fraud schemes in Justice Department history,” federal prosecutors charged more than 300 individuals in a health care scheme that generated approximately $14.6 billion in false claims. After illicitly obtaining funds directly from programs that were designed to help vulnerable Americans, law enforcement seized more than $245 million in cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency and other assets. The largest case is an alleged $10 billion scheme that involved fake urinary catheter claims. </p>
<p>Matthew Galeotti, who leads the U.S. Justice Department’s Criminal Division, stated, “Every fraudulent claim, every fake billing, every kickback scheme represents money taken directly from the pockets of American taxpayers who fund these essential programs through their hard work and sacrifice.” This massive fraud is “more than twice the previous record in the Justice Department’s annual health care fraud crackdown.” Around 100 licensed medical professionals were charged, which includes 25 doctors, with the government reporting $2.9 billion in actual losses. </p>
<h2>6. Europol Dismantles $540 Million Cryptocurrency Fraud Network</h2>
<h4>Source: <a href=""https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/europol-dismantles-540-million.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The Hacker News</a> | June 30, 2025 </h4>
<p>Europol announced that more than 5,000 victims worldwide were targeted in a sophisticated cryptocurrency investment fraud network that allegedly stole around EUR 460 million ($540 million) through pig butchering scams. This operation led to five arrests in the Canary Islands and Madrid by the Spanish Guardia Civil, and it was supported by Europol and law enforcement from Estonia, France and the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
The criminal network is suspected of establishing a banking network in Hong Kong, allegedly routing illicit funds through gateways and user accounts to cover up paper trails. Europol stated in the announcement that, “The leaders of the criminal network allegedly used a net of associates spread around the world to raise funds through cash withdrawals, bank transfers and crypto-transfers.” <br/>
<br/>
While these are not the only major fraud cases from 2025 so far, these case studies highlight recent fraud trends and the sophisticated and growing nature of fraud schemes. From government corruption to cryptocurrency schemes and celebrity wire fraud, these cases highlight the value for international and cross-departmental cooperation to detect and deter fraudulent activities. </p>

15,<h1>Educating Future Fraud Fighters: The Power of Case-Based Learning</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Dr. Princely Dibia,  Ph.D., CFE, FHEA</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>As fraud schemes evolve in complexity, the skills required of fraud examiners must go far beyond textbook definitions and binary classifications. The next generation of Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs) must navigate blurred ethical boundaries, hidden conflicts of interest and inconsistent regulatory standards across industries and borders. </p>
<p>To meet this challenge, we need to shift our pedagogical approach. We must do more than teach fraud — we must teach how to think about fraud. The most effective way I have found to do this is through case-based learning. </p>
<h2>Reconstructing Fraud in All Its Complexity </h2>
<p>One of the key findings from my research into fraud risks in lean organizations is that the concept of fraud is not universally understood. In practice, fraud means different things to different stakeholders. For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>A library security officer may not consider it fraud when someone walks out with a book without registering it. They may perhaps assume forgetfulness rather than malicious intent. </li>
<li>In law, fraud is framed around <em>mens rea</em> and <em>actus reus</em>, with clear thresholds of intent and harm. </li>
<li>In retail loss prevention, fraud can be equated with malice, intent and shrinkage. </li>
<li>In ethics literature, it may be treated as a deviant workplace behavior, sometimes without formal criminality. </li>
<li>Cross-border practices differ. For instance, the legal and regulatory definitions and scope of bribery differ across the U.K., U.S. and EU. </li>
</ul>
<p>These divergent understandings impact how organizations interpret, detect and counter fraud. Without appreciating such context and nuance, we risk preparing students with abstract definitions rather than actionable insight. <br/>
<br/>
This is why in my forensic accounting and fraud risk modules, I embed case-based teaching, allowing students to wrestle with real-world ambiguity rather than hypothetical clarity. </p>
<h2>Simulating Fraud and Not Just Explaining It </h2>
<p>In the classroom, I reconstruct real-life fraud cases such as Adelphia, HIH Insurance and Bond Corp. These are modified and anonymized, with simulated data, company memos, whistleblower tips and internal audit reports. <br/>
<br/>
Students are grouped into roles: investigators, internal auditors, external consultants and senior managers. As they navigate these messy scenarios, they are asked to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Examine transactions and emails. </li>
<li>Interpret partially conflicting witness statements. </li>
<li>Make risk-based decisions with incomplete data. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some realize too late that a red flag was overlooked. Others debate whether a violation was malicious or merely negligent. These reflections mimic the challenges that confront fraud examiners in practice, where low intent is often unclear and judgment must be exercised under uncertainty. </p>
<h2>Results That Reflect Reality </h2>
<p>Through this approach, students do not merely memorize fraud schemes. They experience the complexity of detecting, managing and preventing fraud. This experiential learning builds: </p>
<ul>
<li>Professional skepticism: questioning even when data seems clean. </li>
<li>Judgment under pressure: deciding what to report, escalate or monitor. </li>
<li>Forensic curiosity: following financial trails and behavioral cues. </li>
<li>Ethical resilience: holding one’s ground even when fraud is minimized or rationalized. </li>
</ul>
<p>In post-case debriefings, students frequently express how surprised they are by their own susceptibility to moral disengagement — or how easily they rationalized ""small"" violations. These are exactly the lessons they must learn now, before they face them in the field. </p>
<h2>Shaping the Future of Fraud Examination </h2>
<p>Case-based learning is a professional development strategy, as it is a teaching method. It enables future CFEs to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Understand fraud as a violation of internal controls, not just external law. </li>
<li>Navigate the cultural and organizational norms that shape fraud tolerance. </li>
<li>Develop a mindset that sees fraud risk not as a static list of red flags, but as a fluid interaction of intent, context and consequence. </li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who has both researched and taught fraud for over a decade, I have found that the case method best equips students with the critical thinking and investigative reflexes they need. </p>
<h2>Teaching Judgment, Not Just Rules </h2>
<p>Fraud education must evolve. To truly prepare tomorrow’s examiners, we must go beyond binary definitions and idealized scenarios. We must equip them to operate in systems where: </p>
<ul>
<li>Rules are unclear. </li>
<li>Intent is contested. </li>
<li>Structures may enable fraud. </li>
<li>Responses require courage as much as competence. </li>
</ul>
<p>Through case-based learning, we provide students with what they will need most in the workplace: not just content, but judgment. Not just knowledge, but clarity and resilience in the face of ethical ambiguity. </p>

16,"<h1>Swipe, Smile, Scam: How Your Popcorn Bill May Be Funding Fraud</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Anuj  Choudhary,  CFE, CA, CISA</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Movie theatres have long been associated with entertainment, leisure and quality family time. A visit to a multiplex is often about more than just the film; it is about the experience. However, beneath the layers of buttered popcorn and fizzy drinks could lie a scheme so well-orchestrated that it goes unnoticed, not only by customers but also by management. </p>
<p>What follows is one encounter at a movie theater involving questionable practices, which the author then provides details on, including controls and best practices that may be ignored in these types of fast-paced business environments.</p>
<h2>The Initial Transaction</h2>
<p>The server asked me to pay INR 910 — INR 400 for the nachos and INR 510 for the soda — and I gave him my card to collect the payment. The server was unable to post the sale in the system, which appeared to be for a nachos combo, which included a large popcorn, nachos and large drink, totaling INR 1190. The combo was showing up on the register as having the payment split, raising my suspicion. I followed up with the server, stating that I did not order the combo, to which he replied that it was someone else’s bill. The server then called another server over, who proceeded to change the initial nachos and large drink for INR 910 to the nachos combo for INR 1190, adding that partial payment was made in cash for INR 280 and charged my card for the remaining balance of INR 910.</p>
<p>My instincts flagged the transaction as suspicious, but before I could probe further, the food was handed over. I was hurriedly asked to share my mobile number since the print bill system wasn’t functioning. I complied, providing my number with an expectation that the digital bill would follow shortly. At that point, I was still optimistic and moved on. But as the movie resumed, the receipt never arrived. By the time the credits rolled, I had a growing discomfort about the entire interaction.</p>
<h2>Post-Screening Investigation</h2>
<p>
Post-screening, I revisited the counter and requested the bill again. This time, I spoke with the on-duty manager, who checked the system and asked me for the timestamp of payment, which was available in the SMS for payment. The manager confirmed a payment of INR 910 via card. He also confirmed that the remaining portion of the combo — roughly INR 280, the cost difference of popcorn in the combo — was marked as settled via cash. I had never made any cash payment. </p>
<p>I requested a copy of the invoice, to which he said that the reprint is not feasible. I then asked him to allow me to take photograph of the billing system. He refused.</p>
<p>
I told him I had only ordered and collected the nachos and soda, so why have I been billed for popcorn as well? Rather than surprised, he was afraid. Then, I asked him to share the copy of CCTV footage. He refused to share it, but I asked him to review it and verify what I had purchased.</p>
<p>He checked the footage and returned and said, “Sir you are right, you have not taken the popcorn, but the bill is posted and adjusted with split payments for a combo.”</p>
<p>I requested him to call his manager so that I could speak to him, but he said he would look into this and would come back with a proper justification within two days, for which he even took my mobile number.</p>
<p>I then asked for a full refund per the multiplex’s policy; if the invoice is not provided at the time of purchase, then the food is on the multiplex. He simply took out INR 910 from the cash register and gave it to me with an assurance that he would come back to me with justification.</p>
<h2>The Suspected Fraud Mechanism </h2>
<p>
Thinking like a fraud examiner, I identified a potential modus of fraud via asset misappropriation through a combination of cash larceny and skimming. Let’s define what these terms are:</p>
<p>Cash larceny is a scheme in which an incoming payment is stolen after it has been recorded on the organization’s books.</p>
<p>Skimming is a scheme in which an incoming payment is stolen from an organization before it is recorded on the organization’s books.</p>
<p>In the suspected scheme, INR 290 is stolen per transaction by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misrepresenting the sale of popcorn as a combo sale (cash larceny).</li>
<li>Reselling the same as an a la carte item to another customer (skimming).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s examine the anatomy of what appears to be a classic cash larceny scheme — a sub-category of asset misappropriation, as defined by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE).</p>
<p><strong>Combo Pricing Arbitrage</strong>: A popcorn tub alone costs around INR 570. However, in a combo, it is effectively priced at INR 280–300 due to bundled discounts.</p>
<p><strong>Unauthorized Adjustments</strong>: When a customer requests only two out of three combo items, the server bills them under the combo but does not give the third item. He charges the full amount via card and marks the remaining combo value as paid in cash, a payment never actually made.</p>
<p><strong>Pocketing the Difference</strong>: The server does not hand over the unclaimed popcorn to the customer. Instead, he uses the popcorn later for another cash-paying customer, accepts INR 570 and pockets the difference of INR 290 as unrecorded income. The popcorn is already falsely billed in the earlier combo, creating a double gain opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Receipt Suppression</strong>: Customers are often not issued bills or receive them only after follow-ups, ensuring minimal evidence trails.</p>
<p>This scheme not only defrauds the customer by charging for items not received but also defrauds the employer by skimming cash revenue and suppressing billing records.</p>
<h2>The Three Weaknesses</h2>
<p>
Such frauds typically exploit weaknesses, lapsing internal controls and leading to system failure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of Rotational Duties of Supervisor: Despite having multiple outlets, there are little to no rotations in the supervisors’ duties. This is one of the factors that leads to development of a strong collusion between the supervisor and frontline team.</li>
<li>Manual Overrides and Combo Flexibility: Systems allowing split-mode payments and combo-to-standalone adjustments enable concealment.</li>
<li>Non-Mandatory Bill Issuance: Customers often do not ask for a receipt, especially when they are carrying snacks during an intermission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reconciliation between combo versus à la carte sales is not stringently tracked in many POS systems. This lack of visibility fuels continued leakage.</p>
<h2>The Psychology Behind the Fraud</h2>
<p>
This fraud works because it targets three human actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trust in Uniformed Staff: Customers rarely doubt that cinema employees can get involved in any kind of fraudulent schemes.</li>
<li>Rush and Need: Normally, the intermission is in such a small time frame that customers rush to get the food quickly before the film resumes.</li>
<li>Bill Indifference: Customers rarely ask for receipts at food counters in multiplexes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These behavioral signals are manipulated expertly to conduct fraud without resistance.</p>
<h2>Ethics in Customer Experience: Compromising Customers Trust</h2>
<p>
In addition to financial losses, such actions compromise customer morale. When a brand lacks transparency, whether intentionally or unintentionally, it undermines consumer confidence. If a customer receives neither an invoice nor a detailed breakdown of charges, it raises concerns regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>The integrity of delivery service.</li>
<li>Potential misuse of personal data (such as sharing mobile numbers under false pretenses).</li>
<li>The company's culture of accountability.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations for Management:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Require all invoices to automatically have the payment breakup that shows the cash and other modes with amounts.</li>
<li>Utilize AI to analyze sales on a real-time basis wherein the unusual splits between card and cash are flagged.</li>
<li>Rotation of duties of supervisors if there are multiple outlets in the city.</li>
<li>Separate containers for combo and a la carte orders, and day-end reconciliation by an evening auditor of the sales register with count of containers that were liquidated.</li>
<li>Review camera footage of billing counters for transactions marked as “combo,” but visibly showing only two items handed over.</li>
<li>Combo adjustments should require a supervisor override and a detailed check during audits.</li>
<li>Regular audit of transaction logs vs. item movement in inventory by utilizing the audit trail.</li>
<li>Encourage internal staff to flag such practices anonymously.</li>
<li>Surprise audits and mystery shopping should be encouraged, by way of random checks to ensure compliance and discourage unethical behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advice to the Customers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Never leave the counter without a bill. If they say the printer is not working, request a digital copy immediately. If it is not delivered within minutes, raise it with the duty manager.</li>
<li>If you paid by card, ensure the entire amount is reflected as such in the invoice. If the invoice shows “cash” or “split payment” but you did not tender cash, demand a correction.</li>
<li>If something feels wrong, escalate immediately. Ask for the store manager or file a formal complaint with corporate leadership.</li>
</ul>

17,<h1>Whistleblower Support: What the U.K. Can Learn from the U.S. and Canada</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Martin Kenney </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>In recent years, both the <a href=""https://www.clearygottlieb.com/news-and-insights/publication-listing/whistleblowing-in-focus-part-one-developments-in-the-us"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">United States</a> and <a href=""https://www.whistleblowers.org/canada-whistleblower-reward-laws/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Canada</a> have implemented successful models to incentivize whistleblowers. These models have proven instrumental in uncovering complex fraud schemes and recovering substantial assets for taxpayers. This approach stands in stark contrast to the U.K., where such initiatives remain notional and often met with skepticism. </p>
<p>Fraud constitutes <a href=""https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/what-we-do/crime-threats/fraud-and-economic-crime"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">41% of all crime</a> in England and Wales, costing the economy an estimated <a href=""https://financialaccountant.co.uk/features/protecting-clients-against-fraud/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">GBP 219 billion annually</a>. Nick Ephgrave, Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), has been <a href=""https://whistleblowersblog.org/global-whistleblowers/uks-sfo-director-continues-to-push-for-whistleblower-awards/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">vocal in his support</a> for adopting whistleblower reward programs. He argues that incentivizing individuals to come forward with credible information can accelerate investigations, cut through data complexities and deliver justice more swiftly to victims. </p>
<h2>Why the U.K. is Losing Whistleblower Leads </h2>
<p>Ephgrave's advocacy for a government consultation on whistleblower rewards is timely and necessary. His agency's ability to attract informants has waned over the years, with many opting to share intelligence with U.S. authorities due to the established reward systems there. This not only undermines British investigations but also diminishes potential recoveries that could benefit the U.K. economy. </p>
<p>The suggestion to introduce reward schemes for whistleblowers in the U.K. has sparked debate within legal circles. Critics, particularly defense lawyers, express concerns about the reliability and persuasiveness of evidence provided by informants. Those critics fear that incentivized testimony may compromise the integrity of trials and unfairly sway juries. Yet, we should consider the position of the individual as well as the firm. </p>
<p>A <a href=""https://bsquarelaw.co.uk/understanding-whistleblowing-a-study-of-employee-perspectives-on-reporting-wrongdoing-in-the-uk/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">recent study</a> by Bloomsbury Square Employment Law revealed that a staggering 51% of U.K. employees did not feel safe or confident disclosing instances of misconduct, with 39% citing ""fear of retaliation or bullying"" as the primary deterrent to reporting breaches. Additionally, only 50% of employees surveyed were aware of their firm’s whistleblowing policy. </p>
<h2>The Power of Incentives </h2>
<p>In the U.S. and Canada, reward programs have not only enhanced the detection of fraud, they have also led to substantial financial recoveries. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for instance, has disbursed <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/whistleblower-program"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">millions of dollars in rewards</a> to whistleblowers, underscoring the efficacy of such initiatives in stimulating actionable leads and dismantling sophisticated criminal networks.  </p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href=""https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@newsroom/documents/file/wb_factsheet_final.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Dodd-Frank Act of 2010</a> has created strong whistleblowing support for those brave enough to come forward. There are reward payments offered if sanctions of USD 1 million or more are imposed. The whistleblower can receive anywhere between 10%–30% of this fine. The <a href=""https://www.whistleblowers.org/canada-whistleblower-reward-laws/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Canadian</a> versions of the Dodd-Frank Act are similar in format, with the recovery needing to exceed CAD 100,000, which qualifies the informant for 5%–15% of the additional federal tax collected. </p>
<p>As it stands, a mere 5% of SFO cases in the U.K. have their derivation in whistleblower complaints. Conversely, 86% of penalties imposed by U.S. enforcement agencies originate from whistleblower leads.  </p>
<p>“Nearly 100% of all whistleblowing cases that go to U.K. courts will fail,” <a href=""https://www.ftadviser.com/regulation/2025/3/14/why-do-97-of-all-whistleblowing-cases-fail/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">according to data</a> from Whistleblowers U.K., a whistleblowing organization. These statistics alone should act as the catalyst for change. </p>
<p>As the U.K. considers adopting new measures, it is crucial to address implementation challenges and mitigate potential drawbacks. Transparency in reward criteria, rigorous vetting processes and safeguards against frivolous claims are essential to maintain the credibility of informant-driven evidence. </p>
<h2>Building a Modern Framework for Whistleblower Protection </h2>
<p>Comprehensive legislative reforms are warranted to empower investigative agencies with the tools and resources necessary to effectively combat modern fraud schemes. The review by <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-disclosure-and-fraud-offences"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Fisher KC</a>, a prominent barrister, on enhancing fraud detection capabilities and updating legislative frameworks, such as the Fraud Act 2006, is a step in the right direction. It highlights the need for adaptive legal mechanisms that keep pace with evolving criminal tactics and ensure robust judicial responses. </p>
<p>The U.K. stands at a pivotal juncture in its fight against financial crime. Embracing whistleblower reward schemes represents a paradigm shift towards proactive enforcement and greater accountability. By incentivizing individuals to expose wrongdoing, we not only strengthen our ability to prosecute offenders, but also deter future misconduct. </p>
<p>The transformative impact of whistleblower incentives is not just about financial rewards, but about upholding the principles of justice, protecting taxpayers' interests and restoring public trust in regulatory oversight. The time has come for the U.K. to heed the lessons from across the Atlantic and forge a path towards a more resilient and responsive anti-fraud framework. They seize the opportunity to empower whistleblowers, enhance investigative outcomes and safeguard financial integrity. seize the opportunity to empower whistleblowers, enhance investigative outcomes and safeguard financial integrity. </p>

19,<h1>How Leadership Rationalizes Fraud in the Name of Efficiency</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Dr. Princely Dibia,  Ph.D., CFE, FHEA</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                “When you lock things up … you don’t sell as many of them. We’ve kind of proven that pretty conclusively.” These were comments from the <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/walgreens-lock-product-up-sales/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">CEO of Walgreens</a> regarding its anti-shoplifting strategy in the early weeks of January 2025. While this observation refers to a specific retail challenge, it prompted a deeper reflection on the findings of my research study on fraud in another global retail chain store. With that, a question came to mind: What if the largest enabler of fraud was an executive who believed they were doing the right thing for the business? <br/>
<br/>
Fraud is not always committed with malicious intent. Sometimes, it is rationalized, by senior leaders no less, as a necessary compromise to survive in a competitive marketplace. When commercial pressures intensify, the moral clarity that underpins anti-fraud work can begin to erode. What is left is a culture where small infractions are tolerated, oversight is deprioritized and ethical concerns are reframed as inefficiencies. <br/>
<h2>When Fraud Becomes a Business Strategy </h2>
Lean, agile and streamlined operations are now seen as markers of high-performing organizations. But in such environments, controls are often minimized, responsibilities blurred and accountability diluted, mostly in the name of efficiency. <br/>
<br/>
In one case study, senior managers rationalized recurring refund fraud and inventory discrepancies as a “cost of doing business.” Thus, because the amounts were individually small and resolving them would introduce “friction” into the customer experience, they were not treated as fraud at all. Losses were absorbed, not investigated. The organization had developed a silent tolerance for fraud, provided it did not upset performance metrics. <br/>
<br/>
From a counter-fraud perspective, this is alarming. When leaders reframe unethical conduct as strategic or commercially justified, fraud ceases to be treated as a breach. Instead, it becomes an acceptable operational reality. <br/>
<h2>Understanding Rationalizations Through Neutralization Theory </h2>
To understand how fraud becomes normalized in organizations, we turn to <a href=""https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/neutralization-theory#:~:text=Neutralization%20theory%20is%20a%20significant,perceived%20harm%20of%20their%20actions."" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">neutralization theory</a>, a framework developed by sociologists Sykes and Matza. This theory, which was originally used to explain juvenile delinquency, outlines how individuals justify deviant behavior without seeing themselves as wrongdoers. In a corporate context, especially at leadership levels, these techniques are often present and institutionalized. Here is how they are likely to play out: <br/>
<h3>1. Denial of Responsibility </h3>
<p>
<em>“We had no choice. With limited staff and budget constraints, we had to cut corners.” </em></p>
<p>With such statements, leaders absolve themselves of agency by blaming external pressures or systemic limitations. </p>
<h3>2. Denial of Injury </h3>
<p>
<em>“It’s minor. These claims barely move the needle financially.”</em><em></em></p>
<p>In this instance, fraud is downplayed as harmless, especially if it does not cause immediate, visible damage. </p>
<h3>3. Denial of Victim </h3>
<p>
<em>“No one’s really being hurt. These are just technicalities.” </em></p>
<p>Here, victims, whether internal or external, are abstracted or dismissed. </p>
<h3>4. Condemnation of the Condemners </h3>
<p>
<em>“These auditors don’t understand how business works.” </em></p>
<p>In this case, watchdogs, stewards and critics are painted as naive, bureaucratic or disconnected from commercial reality. </p>
<h3>5. Appeal to Higher Loyalties </h3>
<p>
<em>“We did it for the team. This keeps the company alive.” </em></p>
<p>With this technique, ethical breaches are reframed as sacrifices made for a greater organizational good. </p>
<p>Each of these rationalizations helps leaders maintain a self-image of integrity, even if they permit or ignore unethical conduct. The result is a workplace culture where fraud is no longer something to be prevented, but something to be managed and tolerated. </p>
<h2>Cultural Red Flags and What CFEs Can Do </h2>
<p>To mitigate this problem, fraud professionals must work with the awareness of detecting unethical acts and decoding the narratives that are used to excuse them. Here are some red flags to watch for in leadership discourse: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language that minimizes misconduct:</strong> Phrases like “it’s just the cost of doing business” or “we can’t police everything.” </li>
<li><strong>Overuse of performance rationales:</strong> These are ethical concerns framed as impediments to growth or speed. </li>
<li><strong>Discrediting of oversight functions:</strong> Internal audit, compliance or whistleblower channels are dismissed as disruptive. </li>
</ul>
<h2>How Can CFEs and Internal Auditors Respond? </h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document Rationalizations:</strong> Include them in audit reports and fraud investigations as indicators of cultural risk, not just behavioral anomalies. </li>
<li><strong>Use Cultural Audits: </strong>Go beyond process reviews. Explore how ethics are discussed and prioritized, or deprioritized, within leadership teams. </li>
<li><strong>Reframe the Conversation:</strong> Instead of focusing solely on policy breaches, spotlight how unchecked rationalizations weaken long-term resilience, reputation and stakeholder trust. </li>
<li><strong>Engage Leadership with Data and Values:</strong> Show that ethics and efficiency are not mutually exclusive. Use fraud loss data to connect integrity with sustainability. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fraud is not always hidden. Sometimes, it is rationalized in full view. In organizations that prioritize efficiency, neutrality becomes a shield, controls can be seen as optional and oversight may be treated as obstruction. Those who question these assumptions are dismissed as disconnected or “too idealistic.” </p>

20,<h1>Promotion Playbook for New Fraud Fighters</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>In the anti-fraud profession, proving your worth can feel counter-intuitive: when you do your job well, losses are prevented and red flags never see daylight. This “invisible” success often leaves early-career examiners wondering how to translate daily wins into a persuasive case for a raise or promotion. To demystify the process, we sat down with two seasoned leaders on the front lines of fraud fighting, Michael Booher, CFE, and Tina D'Souza, CFE, who collectively manage teams, budgets and investigations across multiple sectors.</p>
<p>In this candid Q&amp;A, Booher and D'Souza expose the metrics, mindsets and soft skills they weigh when evaluating junior staff. From performance indicators and certifications that move the needle to the interpersonal traits that keep teams running, they outline a practical roadmap for turning promise into promotion. Whether you’re preparing for your first performance review or mapping a multi-year career path, their insights will help you frame achievements, target growth areas and speak the language that resonates with decision-makers.</p>
<h2>What specific achievements, metrics or performance indicators do you look for when deciding if a junior anti-fraud professional is ready for a raise or promotion?</h2>
<p><strong>Michael Booher</strong>: Has the person grown since their hire? During the job interview, did they state that certain goals or achievements would be completed after hire? Did that person deliver on that? Does the professional’s performance indicate that they are ready for additional responsibility? When faced with a challenge in the past, did the person approach it as a burden or an opportunity? Did this person acquire a new skill to overcome the challenge?</p>
<p>Fraud examination is a diverse and complex field, but in general, a person’s performance is not based on the number of “widgets” produced. Having said that, has the person shown that they can complete assignments and that their efficiency improved over time?</p>
<p>Beyond all that, of course, would be the question of has the person obtained relevant certifications, licenses or other notable achievements? This would be especially important to consider if their employer offers incentives, reimbursements, guaranteed bonuses or other resources to employees to pursue these things. If they cannot capitalize on benefits or incentives that are already available, then why should they be rewarded?</p>
<p><strong>Tina D'Souza</strong>: When assessing a junior anti-fraud professional for a raise or promotion, I look for a combination of qualitative and quantitative indicators. Key metrics include the number of cases/alerts handled, detection rates, recovery values, collaboration with various teams, accuracy of case management notes and resolution within the agreed SLO’s in investigations.  </p>
<p>However, beyond the numbers, I value consistency in the execution and implementation of work, ownership, demonstration of critical thinking, initiatives undertaken or designed in identifying emerging fraud patterns, and contributions to improving processes or controls within the team. In a nutshell, providing value-added services over and beyond one’s mandate, identifying the needs of your team, thinking like a manager and anticipating the requirements of a manager, working with different people and possessing a solution mindset goes a long way in positioning oneself as a potential candidate to be considered for promotion or motivated through a raise. </p>
<p>Some examples of notable achievements might include uncovering a significant fraud scheme, developing an effective detection tool, an effective RCM or contributing to cross-functional projects. Lastly, reliability, integrity and strong communication skills — especially in delivering tough messages to stakeholders — are non-negotiable traits that signal readiness for greater responsibility.</p>
<h2>What skills are most critical for advancing in an anti-fraud role, and how can entry-level employees develop these skills quickly?</h2>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: The role of a fraud examiner is so diverse and broad that it’s practically impossible to identify a couple of absolute technical skills that the person must have to be successful. A person needs to be generally adept and adaptable to technical requirements, as these will change and evolve over time. Advancing in an anti-fraud role is really just like advancing in any other career. In general, people who are reliable, capable and relatable are the types of people whom others would like to keep around, compensate and eventually promote.</p>
<p>Sports offer a great analogy. At first, everyone might be impressed with a single teammate’s skills and ability to score goals or points, but over time, the team will suffer if that teammate fails to consider the team’s needs or to be a team player.</p>
<p>If a person is very technically proficient, but they struggle with interpersonal communication or relationship building, then that person needs to put themself into relatively challenging situations that force them to improve those skills. These things do not need to be sophisticated. Can the person assist with an event at the company, like planning a team-building outing or the annual company picnic? Does this show their ability to work well with others in offbeat situations? This will naturally be uncomfortable at first, but as the old saying goes, “no pain, no gain.”</p>
<p>Similarly, if a person is lacking a specific technical skill, then the person should pursue training, education or another development of that skillset.</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: </p>
<p>The most critical skills fall into three categories:</p>
<p>•<span> </span>Technical: Familiarity with data analytics tools (like Excel, SQL, Power BI, Tableau or ACL), case management systems and knowledge of regulatory requirements.<br/>
•<span> </span>Analytical: Strong investigative mindset, ability to identify red flags, art of following up, assess patterns and make connections between seemingly unrelated data points.<br/>
•<span> </span>Interpersonal: Effective communication (both written and verbal), collaboration, diplomacy in sensitive situations and the ability to collaborate with legal, compliance and operational teams.</p>
<p>To develop these skills quickly:</p>
<p>•<span> </span>Volunteer for stretch assignments involving data analysis or process reviews.<br/>
•<span> </span>Shadow senior investigators during case reviews.<br/>
•<span> </span>Attend webinars and training on fraud detection tools and techniques.<br/>
•<span> </span>Regularly review real-world fraud case studies to sharpen pattern-recognition skills.<br/>
•<span> </span>Build a habit of documenting and presenting findings clearly and concisely.</p>
<p>Reframe your approach by:</p>
<p>•<span> </span>Seeking feedback regularly and having a growth mindset.<br/>
•<span> </span>Focusing on building a reputation for integrity, reliability and initiative.<br/>
•<span> </span>Understanding what problems keep leaders up at night — and finding ways to help solve them.</p>
<h2>What advice would you give to someone just starting out in anti-fraud who wants to strategically plan their career path and position themselves for future advancement?</h2>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: I started out with a passion for the anti-fraud industry, but I wasn’t sure how to get there at first. I worked in the periphery as a staff auditor, and I gained valuable entry-level experience. I was then able to move to a job that was slightly closer to the anti-fraud field, and that role introduced me to a Chapter of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners via continuing professional education (CPE). It was networking at those events that landed me a job interview for the role that I always wanted. So, especially starting out, it’s common that a person is not where they plan to stay. The key is to do a good job, build relationships and experience, and take advantage of networking opportunities so that experience and relationships are strong when the “dream job” opportunity (or another steppingstone to reach it) comes knocking.</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: Start by clarifying your long-term career goals — whether you aspire to become a fraud risk manager, forensic auditor or move into financial crime compliance: </p>
<p>•<span> </span>Map out the technical certifications (like the CFE credential) and skill sets needed for those roles.<br/>
•<span> </span>Create a broad foundation by working on different types of cases: financial statement fraud, identity theft, cyber fraud, etc.<br/>
•<span> </span>Build a network on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/acfe/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a> and the <a href=""https://connect.acfe.com/home"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ACFE Community</a> and make connections. Keep sharing thought leadership articles on your LinkedIn profile. <br/>
•<span> </span>Stay curious — fraud trends evolve fast.<br/>
•<span> </span>Seek mentors inside and outside of your organization.<br/>
•<span> </span>Take initiative to set up time for the meetings.<br/>
•<span> </span>Don’t just chase titles; focus on acquiring responsibilities and experience that stretches your skills. </p>
<p>If doing the position yourself, regularly present case learnings and summaries of trainings, suggesting process improvements and contributing to awareness initiatives like fraud prevention workshops or policy updates, can show initiative.</p>
<h2>Are there any professional organizations, conferences or networking groups you recommend to anti-fraud professionals looking to broaden their expertise and stand out?</h2>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: I feel like this goes without saying, but membership in both the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners and a <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/community/chapters"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">local ACFE Chapter</a> is an absolute must for any anti-fraud professional. The ACFE is a world-class organization, and its conferences are the gold standard, but for a job-seeker, a local chapter provides irreplaceable networking opportunities.<br/>
Beyond that, there are more specialized organizations that a person should pursue if he or she has a passion for those things. Examples might include professional organizations that emphasize specialized law enforcement training, digital forensics or interviewing training (among others). If networking via those traditional means is unavailable for some reason, then LinkedIn is a free and easy place to start.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Tina</strong>: Absolutely — networking and continuous learning are vital in this field. Some excellent options include:</p>
<p>•<span> </span>Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) — Global leader for anti-fraud training and resources.<br/>
•<span> </span>Annual conferences like the ACFE Global Fraud Conference or regional fraud summits and events.<br/>
•<span> </span>Volunteering in these communities, writing articles or speaking at events are powerful ways to stand out.<br/>

21,<h1>When Lean Becomes a Liability: How Streamlining Can Enable Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Dr. Princely Dibia,  Ph.D., CFE, FHEA</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Lean operations typically involve removing inefficiencies, trimming costs and accelerating decision-making. Across industries, this strategy of thinking and doing work has become a gold standard for modern business performance. From manufacturing floors to finance teams, organizations are urged to “do more with less.” But while the lean model can drive speed and agility, it also introduces hidden risks such as weakened oversight, blurred accountabilities and a culture that may unintentionally tolerate unethical behavior. <br/>
<h2>The Hidden Risks in ‘Doing More with Less’ </h2>
The principles of lean thinking prioritize efficiency and waste reduction. But lean transformations often result in flatter hierarchies, smaller teams and fewer touchpoints in operational processes. These conditions, while ideal for productivity, can simultaneously dilute key fraud deterrents such as segregation of duties, monitoring and documentation. <br/>
<br/>
In one study, leadership at a lean organization rationalized millions in retail fraud losses, particularly fraudulent refund claims, as a “cost of doing business.” These losses were deprioritized because they were considered statistically insignificant against overall revenue and resolving them would require process friction. This mentality created a permissive environment where internal controls were bypassed in favor of speed and perceived customer satisfaction.  <br/>
<h2>Cultural Drift: When Normalized Deviance Becomes Policy </h2>
Over time, lean organizations can develop a culture where minor ethical compromises become normalized. When teams are overextended, systems are automated and exceptions are quietly tolerated. As a result, fraud risk is likely to increase — not because of bad actors alone but because of systemic blind spots. This risk also grows when fraud and anti-fraud policies are not clearly defined or included in lean systems. <br/>
<br/>
Frontline employees may learn how to exploit these gaps. For instance, a case study involved a retail employee who exploited their access to the point-of-sale and inventory systems to cover up inventory theft. With minimal oversight and high throughput expectations, discrepancies were dismissed as logistical noise. The fraud persisted for years before a whistleblower came forward. <br/>
<br/>
Lean operations can also foster a culture of silence. Employees may hesitate to raise concerns if doing so threatens the appearance of seamless performance. Frontline employees may also lose their motivation to counter fraud or follow-up on suspicious activities when such actions are frequently overruled or discouraged in favor of sales and other customer service objectives. When reporting is perceived as a threat to efficiency, internal fraud signals go unreported.  
<h2>Redesigning Controls for Lean Resilience </h2>
<p>
So how can anti-fraud professionals protect organizations that are intentionally lean without obstructing their strategic goals? </p>
<h3>Here are five practical steps: </h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><strong>1. Map fraud vulnerabilities during process optimization</strong>. Fraud risk assessments should be a core part of any lean design and implementation, not an afterthought. Ask:</p>
<ul style=""margin-left: 80px;"">
<li>What fraud controls — preventive, detective and deterrent — are included in the lean system?  </li>
<li>What new risks do such systems pose and how can they be mitigated? </li>
<li>Is there a clearly defined anti-fraud policy in this system? Does the system have a clearly stated zero-tolerance for fraud, as it has for wastes, overburdening of its people and systems, and unevenness in its processes or workloads? </li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><strong>2. Rotate duties in high-risk roles</strong>. Even in small teams, cross-training and job rotation reduce the opportunity for concealment. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><strong>3. Include frontline insights in fraud planning</strong>. Those closest to the work often see where shortcuts are taken or policies are exploited. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Normalize reporting of small deviations</strong>. Create safe channels to report errors or anomalies early before they become larger issues. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><strong>5. Establish fraud accountability at leadership levels</strong>. Tone at the top matters, especially when leaders rationalize losses to preserve operational performance. </p>
<p>Anti-fraud professionals should aim to embed flexible, adaptive controls into lean environments, such as controls that flag unusual patterns without adding unnecessary bureaucracy. <br/>
<br/>
Lean thinking does not have to compromise integrity, but it likely does when fraud risks are overlooked in the name of efficiency. By understanding the structural and cultural vulnerabilities introduced by lean models, fraud examiners and auditors can better design controls that support both performance and accountability. <br/>
<br/>
Efficiency should never mean sidelining ethics. As we chase leaner operations, we must also double down on ethical vigilance. When fraud is treated as a “cost of doing business,” we invite it to become a business norm. </p>

22,<h1>Road to the CFE Credential: New Certified Fraud Examiners Share Their Journey</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Stefanie Hallgren,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Every year, thousands of anti-fraud professionals from around the world take the next step in their career by becoming a <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/cfe-credential"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE)</a>. Earning the CFE credential is a huge accomplishment — it opens the door to career advancement, the potential for increased earnings, continued learning on the evolution of fraud and so much more. <br/>
<br/>
But what motivates someone to pursue the CFE credential? What does the process really look like from a candidate’s perspective?  <br/>
<br/>
We interviewed two new CFEs to hear about what led them to earning their credential, how the process of obtaining it went, what is next for their career now that they are a CFE and what advice they have for professionals aspiring to obtain their credential one day. 
</p>
<p>Meet Antoinette Spencer, manager of anti-money laundering (AML) examinations at the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) Financial Services Commission, and Irina Temciuc, a senior civilian criminal investigator for the Integrated Market Enforcement Team at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 
</p>
<h3>
What was your career trajectory before obtaining the CFE credential? </h3>
<p>
<strong></strong><strong>Antoinette</strong>: I was engaged in the regulatory compliance space since 2020 before transitioning to AML regulations in 2023, primarily within the financial services sector as a senior AML analyst. Working within a regulatory body allowed me to engage with various sectors, including non-profit organizations (NPO), legal, real estate and corporate services, gaining insight into their unique AML challenges. Over time, I became increasingly interested in the intersection of fraud and money laundering, which led me to seek deeper knowledge in fraud prevention. </p>
<p>
<strong>Irina</strong>: With an international master’s degree in economics and finance, my career began in asset management, where I spent seven years honing my skills in client partnerships and portfolio management. Along the way, earning the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) charter deepened my understanding of the financial system and asset management, but more importantly, it sparked a keen interest [for me] in the intersection between finance and misconduct. That curiosity led me to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s (RCMP) Integrated Market Enforcement Team (IMET), where I saw an opportunity to apply my financial background in a more investigative and impactful way. Since 2023, I’ve been working as a senior investigator with IMET, contributing to crime investigations and continuing to build on my passion for uncovering the truth behind the numbers. </p>
<h3>
Why did you decide to obtain your CFE credential?</h3>
<p>
<strong>Antoinette</strong>: Much of my work involved analyzing financial records for suspicious activity reporting and ensuring there was no misuse of NPO funds. One specific project I worked on sparked my interest in pursuing professional studies to formalize my research, analysis and reporting methods. 
After conducting research on suitable certifications to broaden my knowledge, I found the CFE [credential] to be the ideal fit. The CFE credential provided a globally respected framework that aligned well with my role in regulation and offered an opportunity to build credibility in a constantly evolving field. 
</p>
<p><strong>Irina</strong>: As financial markets evolve, so does the sophistication and scope of fraud schemes and market manipulation. I saw the CFE credential as a strategic and necessary step to strengthen my investigative capabilities. The program's focus on forensic accounting, fraud detection, legal elements and investigative techniques closely aligned with my growing interest in financial misconduct. </p>
<p>For someone transitioning from capital markets into financial crime enforcement, the CFE offers a powerful toolkit, bridging my financial expertise with the specialized knowledge required to identify, investigate and prevent complex fraud. It is a credential that not only complements my background but directly supports the impact I aim to make in my current role. 
</p>
<h3>
What did your study method look like? </h3>
<p>
<strong>Antoinette</strong>: I was determined to complete the course within a three-to-four-month period and was excited to discover the <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/cfe-exam-preparation/90-day-cfe-exam-challenge"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">90-Day CFE Exam Challenge</a>, as I enjoy a good challenge. I used the <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/cfe-exam-preparation/cfe-exam-prep---study-on-your-own-options"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><em>CFE Exam Prep Course</em></a> as my primary study tool and created a timeline for completion. I set specific goals to stay on track and took handwritten notes to reinforce my learning. The practice questions were particularly helpful — not only for retention but also for becoming familiar with the exam format. 
I made sure to balance my study time with regular breaks, rewarding myself with a 15-minute break to browse social media after completing a section. This approach helped prevent burn-out and allowed me to stay consistent throughout my study period. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Irina</strong>: I adopted a structured and balanced approach that allowed me to build both a strong conceptual foundation and practical exam readiness. For areas where I felt I needed a deeper understanding, I relied heavily on the study manual. These resources were invaluable in helping me grasp complex technical topics and refine my analytical thinking. </p>
<p>I dedicated a significant amount of time to practicing online using the <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/cfe-exam-preparation/cfe-exam-prep---study-on-your-own-options/fraud-examiners-manual"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">preparation packages</a> provided. This helped me strengthen my application skills and become more comfortable with the format and expectations of the CFE Exam. 
</p>
<h3>
What advice would you give to someone hoping to start the journey of obtaining their CFE credential? </h3>
<p>
<strong>Antoinette</strong>: Start with a clear reason for why you want the credential. That motivation will carry you through the more challenging moments. Be patient with yourself, set a realistic study schedule and focus on understanding the concepts rather than memorizing them. The CFE Exam is designed to test your practical judgment, so your professional experience will be a valuable asset. Stay committed and take it one step at a time. 
</p>
<p><strong>Irina</strong>: Trust the process! I believe developing a study strategy that balances technical understanding with lots of practice is key. It's important to identify your weak areas early on and focus on understanding the content, practice consistently and be strategic with your study time. The more you practice under realistic conditions, the better you'll get at time management, identifying key issues and structuring your responses. 
</p>
<h3>
Did you learn something new by studying for the exam?</h3>
<p>
<strong>Antoinette</strong>: Absolutely. While I had significant experience in AML, studying for the CFE Exam gave me a deeper understanding of areas such as financial statement fraud, occupational fraud schemes, insurance fraud and internal controls. It helped me see financial crime from a more holistic perspective and strengthened my ability to identify and assess fraud risks that may not be immediately obvious. 
</p>
<p><strong>Irina</strong>: Although I have a background in investment management, the CFE program still provided me with valuable new insights and knowledge. Fraud examination touches on areas such as forensic accounting, legal considerations, fraud prevention strategies and investigative techniques. </p>
<p>What I found especially enriching was the exposure to real-world fraud scenarios and the structured approach to detecting and investigating fraud. The legal elements broadened my perspective and deepened my understanding of the broader implications of financial misconduct. 
</p>
<h3>
What’s next in your career? How do you plan to use your CFE credential? </h3>
<strong>Antoinette</strong>: I plan to continue advancing in the regulatory AML and compliance field, and I’m excited to share that I’ve been promoted since earning the CFE designation! 
This credential has expanded my skill set and will enable me to make more meaningful contributions to financial investigations, institutional supervision and policy development. Additionally, the CFE credential will allow me to share valuable insights with the various sectors my organization oversees during our outreach sessions. In the long term, I aspire to help shape national and regional frameworks that enhance transparency and strengthen resilience in the financial sector. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Irina</strong>: The CFE credential strengthens my credibility and equips me with a more structured, globally recognized framework for detecting, investigating and preventing fraud. Therefore, earning the CFE credential is both a natural progression and a strategic step forward. What’s next in my career is to continue deepening my expertise, take on more complex investigations and position myself for leadership opportunities within the financial crime and fraud space.

23,<h1>Learning from JPMorgan's $175M Due Diligence Error</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>JPMorgan Chase’s $175 million acquisition of a student financial aid platform, Frank, represented what the banking giant hoped would be an innovative step into the educational market. Instead, it became a case that can be presented for how even major financial institutions can still fall victim to determined fraudsters.</p>
<h2>What Happened?</h2>
<p>In late 2021, JPMorgan <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921005169/en/JPMorgan-Chase-Acquires-Frank-the-Leading-College-Financial-Planning-Platform-for-Students"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">announced </a>they were acquiring Frank, a fintech startup founded by Charlie Javice that promised to simplify the college financial aid application process. The company reportedly had more than four million users who used the app to help them navigate the complex and difficult process of applying for financial aid. However, by December 2022, JPMorgan filed a civil lawsuit against Javice, alleging fraudulent claims over the amount of customers Frank had. Instead of the around four million customers Javice reported, Frank had fewer than 300,000 actual users. Federal prosecutors then brought criminal charges in early 2023, and in March 2025, <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2025/03/29/nx-s1-5344434/charlie-javice-convicted-defrauding-jpmorgan"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Javice was found guilty on multiple counts</a>, including securities fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy charges. </p>
<p>The discrepancy was significant, as Frank had only about 7% of the users it claimed to have during negotiations with JPMorgan Chase. Evidence showed that Javice had actually hired a data scientist for around <a href=""https://fortune.com/2023/01/12/fintech-jpmorgan-frank-lawsuit-emails-charlie-javice/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">$18,000 to create synthetic user data</a>, which was then presented to JPMorgan during the acquisition process as a selling point.</p>
<h2>A Case Study on Due Diligence</h2>
<p>Due diligence is designed to verify claims, assess risks and determine accurate valuations. In a 2023 <em><a href=""/fraud-magazine/all-issues/issue/article?s=2023-janfeb-fraud-basics-prevent-fraud-due-diligence"" target=""_blank"">Fraud Magazine</a></em> article, Mandy Yousif, CFE, described due diligence as “an essential preemptive measure against fraud, and failing to apply it can be detrimental."" For companies and organizations where user numbers directly impact valuation, verifying these types of metrics is a fundamental part of proper due diligence. </p>
<p>In acquisitions where a major or substantial portion of the price reflects customer acquisition value, which was the case with Javice’s company, the verification of user data becomes an important step in proper due diligence measures. Think of it this way: each alleged customer essentially represents real monetary value in the transaction, meaning if the number of customers is falsified, the company initiating the acquisition would lose money after the deal is finalized. </p>
<h2>How Did JPMorgan Miss This?</h2>
<p>JPMorgan executives, including Leslie Wims Morris, initially trusted Javice’s claim that Frank had more than four million users and was on track to reach 10 million, with Wims Morris <a href=""https://www.investmentnews.com/industry-news/charlie-javice-convicted-of-defrauding-jpmorgan-over-deal/259901"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">testifying </a>that she “100% trusted the young entrepreneur…” When JPMorgan went to verify these numbers, Javice claimed that user privacy concerns and terms of service agreements prevented her from sharing the user data. From there, the verification process faced several different challenges. JPMorgan enacted a third-party marketing company to verify Frank’s user data, but the third-party company <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-due-diligence-frank-charlie-javice-2023-4"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">primarily counted data fields instead of authenticating actual users</a>. During the trial, evidence showed that the data provided to this verification firm was not Frank’s actual user database but rather synthetically created information designed to appear legitimate.</p>
<p>Additionally, market conditions factored into the situation. Testimony suggested that JPMorgan proceeded with the deal partly due to information indicating that <a href=""https://www.investmentnews.com/industry-news/charlie-javice-convicted-of-defrauding-jpmorgan-over-deal/259901"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Bank of America</a> might also be interested in acquiring Frank. This competitive side is a common factor in corporate acquisitions. While some of JPMorgan’s employees reportedly raised questions about aspects of Frank’s data, these concerns did not ultimately prevent the acquisition from moving forward. On the other side of the case, in an unsuccessful attempt, Javice’s defense argued that JPMorgan suffered <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-had-buyers-remorse-lawyer-says-startup-founders-trial-starts-2025-02-21/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">“buyer’s remorse”</a> after changes in financial aid made the acquisition less valuable.</p>
<h3>Breakdown:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wims Morris, a JPMorgan executive, relied heavily on Javice’s claims about user data.</li>
<li>JPMorgan enacted a third-party verification that proved to be flawed in its approach.</li>
<li>JPMorgan prioritized speed over thoroughness due to the possibility of competition with Bank of America.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prevention Measures</h2>
<p>This case highlights several aspects of the process that companies across industries might consider when evaluating potential acquisitions. Direct database verification represents one important verification method. When possible, having secure, supervised access to a company’s actual customer database would prove valuable insights into user numbers and engagement patterns. Additionally, user sampling can serve as an additional verification layer. Contacting a statistically significant random sample of users can help confirm the existence and engagement of a claimed customer base. </p>
<p>Technical verification of user activity patterns offers another perspective. Real users typically generate consistent, logical patterns of platform engagement that differ from synthetic data. Analyzing these patterns can provide additional confidence in user metrics. Financial reconciliation also provides complementary verification. User numbers typically correlate with certain financial metrics, including server costs, customer service expenditures and marketing expenses. Alignment between alleged or claimed user numbers and operational costs can help validate claims.</p>
<h3>Best Due Diligence Practices in Acquisitions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multi-layered verification process: Employ <strong>multiple </strong>independent verification methods to verify accuracy.</li>
<li>Technical data validation: Use specialized tools to analyze data patterns and identify potentially <strong>synthetic </strong>or <strong>manipulated </strong>information.</li>
<li>Third-party auditing: Engage firms with specific expertise in <strong>data verification</strong> and fraud detection to review the company being potentially acquired.</li>
<li>User contact verification: Implement sampling techniques to <strong>verify </strong>the <strong>existence </strong>and engagement of <strong>actual </strong>users.</li>
<li>Extended timeline considerations: Allow <strong>adequate time</strong> for thorough verification, especially when initial verification attempts encounter road bumps.</li>
<li>Alternative data sources: Identify <strong>external </strong>data points that could corroborate or contradict alleged or claimed metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Charlie Javice's conviction proved that even sophisticated financial institutions encounter fraudsters and should always be following the proper due diligence measures before finalizing any acquisition. While no due diligence process can guarantee absolute protection against fraud, following the proper steps is crucial. JPMorgan Chase’s unfortunate experience with Frank will likely inform future acquisition practices in the future, not just for them, but across the broader financial and technological sectors. </p>

24,<h1>Care Meets Money: A CFE's Guide to the Medical Revenue Cycle</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Colin May,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Dr. Cerre Monroe loved practicing medicine; it was something she had always wanted to do. After years of medical school, residency, board exams and working at a hospital, she opened a private practice. At first, things went well. But as patient volume increased and the insurance regulations became more complex, Monroe started to fall behind — slowly at first, until the shortcuts became routine. <br/>
<br/>
When her most experienced administrative nurse, Rachel, moved to another state, it created a gap in both operations and oversight. A year later, the insurance audit came, then the search warrant at her home and clinic. As she reviewed files to respond to a grand jury subpoena, she wondered what was next. She thought, “Maybe if I had been more diligent and involved in the business side of things, I wouldn’t be in this mess.”  <br/>
<h2>Understanding the Business of Health </h2>
<p>
The above scenario is fictional, but it represents a common reality that fraud examiners encounter. What starts out as well-meaning, mission-oriented work can quickly become overwhelming, and many providers do not pay attention to the intricacies of billing, revenue collection and cost control. Providers and health care leaders need to pay specific attention to the business side of their practice — there is a need and a requirement to have a full-scale compliance and fraud prevention program. Not only will it protect them from being taken advantage of by staff or others they trust, but it is essential because their professional reputation and personal liability is at stake. In fact, <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-111publ148/pdf/PLAW-111publ148.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">federal law</a> requires an effective compliance program as a requirement for participation in programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Compliance in health care is not optional. <br/>
<br/>
Failures to have a strong compliance program can be devastating. In one recent case, defense attorneys for a nurse practitioner said that their client was in over his head:  </p>
<blockquote class=""text-color-option""><q>Part of the reason why [the Defendant] failed to rectify the situation was because his business was chaotic. His employees and third parties billed Medicare and Medicaid with billing codes that many times should not have been used. [The Defendant] was not on top of the billings and should have spent more time understanding the billing codes and when they were appropriate. But turning a blind eye is no excuse and the buck stopped with [the Defendant].”</q></blockquote>
<p>While they infer that others are to blame, the real issue was a lack of compliance infrastructure, leadership and understanding of the business side of healthcare delivery. </p>
<h2>Driving the Circle </h2>
<p>A challenge that many of these providers face is the failure to understand the medical revenue cycle (MRC). The MRC, sometimes simply referred to as the revenue cycle, is a standard way of describing the full scope of patient care, documentation, billing and reimbursement. The documentation and protocols that are derived from the MRC are vital for providers and their staff to understand and follow. </p>
<p>In ""<a href=""https://www.ache.org/learning-center/publications/books/2283"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Understanding Healthcare Financial Management</a>"", Drs. Louis Gapenski and George Pink define MRC as a “set of reoccurring business activities and related information processing associated with providing and collecting [funds] for goods or services provided to [patients].” Most models of MRCs follow a three-phased approach: </p>

<h2>Fraud Risks in the MRC </h2>
<p>Risk abounds in the revenue cycle, particularly fraud risk. For example, in the Pre-Care Activities phase, patient information could be misappropriated and used in identity theft schemes (including the misuse of the patient's Medicare, Medicaid or insurance information). Staff accepting the registration information could embezzle cash co-payments. Insurance certifications could be misused and altered in a way that enables the practice to collect directly from the patient.  <br/>
<br/>
Auditors and investigators must be especially vigilant during the Patient Care and Post-Care Activity phases, where the bulk of fraud schemes arise. The constant pressure of health insurance reimbursement and the inability to get paid timely can exert enormous stress on providers, which could lead to shortcuts, like Dr. Monroe’s situation.  <br/>
<br/>
Common fraud risks to be on the lookout for include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Bribery, kickbacks and self-dealing (e.g., referrals to self-owned facilities). </li>
<li>Upcoding (services that are higher than necessary). </li>
<li>Unbundling (services billed separately but should be billed as one CPT code). </li>
<li>Double billing. </li>
<li>Billing for services not rendered or medically unnecessary. </li>
<li>Billing for medical procedures or services not covered by insurance. </li>
<li>Billing for one procedure but identifying it as something else to mask the true nature of the service (misrepresentation of services to ensure payment). </li>
<li>Routine waiving of co-payments (in violation of insurance policies/contracts). </li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges and Opportunities </h2>
<p>Today’s health care is shaped by staffing shortages, large-scale service disruptions resulting from hospital closures and bankruptcies, cost increases, regulatory uncertainty and legislative changes. However, understanding the implications of these issues — which all present risks — is key, and applying them to the MRC will help fraud examiners appreciate the unique nature of these engagements.  <br/>
<br/>
Conducting audits and evaluations of revenue cycle processes can be a specific area that fraud examiners can assist. In addition to putting controls in place to prevent and detect fraud, fraud examiners can be proactive and support the risk posture of the organization through targeted performance improvement reviews. For example, an audit can help identify specific risk levels and trends when it comes to adequately protecting the practice, hospital or organization. A <a href=""https://utsystem.edu/sites/default/files/documents/ut-system-reports/2019/utsw-revenue-cycle-patient-account-adjustments-and-follow-report/utsw-revenue-cycle-patient-account-adjustments-and-follow-report.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">2019 internal audit report</a> from the University of Texas Southwest hospital is a good example of using the MRC process to assess the effectiveness of controls.  </p>
<h2>Know The MRC And Know the Schemes </h2>
<p>A strong understanding of the revenue cycle is a core part of a fraud examiner’s professional toolkit, as the MRC is fundamental to the industry. Fraud examiners need to educate themselves about health care fraud schemes and learn more about the revenue cycle. Specifically, each engagement should include a close review of the organization’s MRC policies, process and how the staff use them in their daily work. <br/>
<br/>
One industry expert explained to the <a href=""https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/12213/chapter/5#122"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">National Academy of Sciences in 2011</a>:  </p>
<blockquote class=""text-color-option""><q>Providers are paid more if they overuse resources and if they provide poor care leading to rework. They are paid less if they provide such good care that other care is not necessary. They are paid more for technical and episodic tasks and little for cognitive, coordinative work.""</q></blockquote>
It all comes back to the <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/fraud-101-what-is-fraud"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Fraud Triangle</a>: pressure, opportunity and rationalization.  <br/>
<br/>
Comprehending the revenue cycle, the health care landscape, fraud schemes and controls is essential for fraud examiners as we work to prevent, detect and investigate fraud, waste and abuse in health care.

25,"<h1>You Found Fraud, Now What? A Guide to Responding Effectively</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Discovering potential fraud within your organization is never easy — and deciding what to do next can be even harder. Emotions run high. Reputational risks loom large. But timely, decisive action is critical to minimize losses and demonstrate a strong ethical culture. <br/>
<br/>
So, what should you do when fraud is found? <br/>
<h2>How to Respond When Identifying Fraud</h2>
If you have discovered that fraud may have occurred inside your organization, your first step is to report it to the appropriate internal channels, such as a hotline, compliance officer or human resources department. Document what you have observed with as much detail as possible and record things such as dates, behaviors, communications — anything that can help build a clear record for the investigation. Your tip can help stop the damage from growing. <br/>
<h2>Initiate an Internal Investigation </h2>
Once a tip has been received the next step is critical: launching a thorough internal investigation. The scope of fraud needs to be determined before organizations can take disciplinary or legal actions. Your organization should rely on internal audit professionals or Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs) to lead a complete investigation. These first stages demand both evidence preservation and confidentiality to achieve proper results, which requires the right skillsets and training.<br/>
<br/>
Staff members at the organizational level were more likely to receive the most severe consequences in cases of detected fraud, according to <em><a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/?utm_source=acfeinsights&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=20254-You-Found-Fraud-Blog"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Occupational Fraud 2024: A Report to the Nations</a></em>. Staff-level employees faced termination in 77% of cases whereas managers received termination in 65% of cases; owners or executives experienced termination in only 53% of cases. The disparity in levels of disciplinary action proves that investigations need to remain unbiased and fair regardless of the perpetrator's position. <br/>
<h2>Internal vs. External Resolution </h2>
Not every case escalates to law enforcement — nor should it. Of the 43% of organizations that did not make a criminal referral, nearly half (49%) of victim organizations said they opted against referring fraud cases to law enforcement because internal discipline was deemed sufficient. Others cited concerns about negative publicity (34%) or chose private settlements (24%). <br/>
<br/>
The majority of occupational fraud cases (57%) resulted in criminal prosecution. The decision to increase the matter depends on three main variables: the amount of money lost, the nature of the crime and the company's willingness to engage in a public legal process. <br/>
<br/>
The median loss in cases referred to law enforcement was $250,000, which is significantly higher than the $63,000 median loss for those not referred. <br/>
<h2>Know What to Expect from a Criminal Referral </h2>
Referring a fraud case for criminal prosecution can yield strong results. Of those referred in the <em>Report to the Nations</em>, 72% resulted in a guilty plea or were convicted. However, prosecutors declined to pursue 14% of referred cases, while 3% resulted in an acquittal. <br/>
<br/>
The success rate of a fraud case largely depends on proper case preparation through complete documentation combined with expert testimony when necessary. The partnership between legal professionals and investigators often determines whether a prosecution succeeds or fails. <br/>
<h2>Take Preventive Measures Moving Forward </h2>
Finally, use the experience as a catalyst for change. The implementation of these measures should lead to real change by enhancing internal controls, developing stronger whistleblower programs and <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/employee-fraud-awareness-training"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">delivering thorough anti-fraud training to all departments</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Active fraud risk management by organizations creates organizational cultures that promote transparency and accountability and build resilience. The forward-thinking approach not only reduces future fraud risks but also demonstrates the organization’s commitment to integrity and sets the stage for long-term success. Organizations that effectively respond to fraud risks establish a lasting foundation for growth which maintains their ethical framework into the future.

26,<h1>More Than 24 Hours: The Impossible Day Health Care Scheme</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Colin May,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                When it comes to <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/all-products/product-detail-page?s=10-Common-Health-Care-Fraud-Schemes"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">health care fraud</a>, sometimes the numbers alone reveal the crime. We know that one person cannot work more than 23.99 hours per day, since there are only 24 hours in a day. But for some fraudsters, this concept has not clicked — and their billing records reveal just how far they have pushed the limits. Experts call it the “Impossible Day” or “High-Day Billing.” <br/>
<h2>Impossible Day Fraud Schemes </h2>
Impossible day fraud schemes are defined as occurring when a health care provider purports to provide such a high volume of patient services or procedures in single day (24-hour period) that there is no way the provider could have reasonably performed them. <a href=""https://www.ama-assn.org/topics/cpt-codes"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Current Procedural Terminology</a> (CPT) Codes — established by the American Medical Association to ensure consistent billing and data collection — are particularly vulnerable when time is a critical part of the services provided.  <br/>
<br/>
Behavioral health CPT codes are especially susceptible to this type of manipulation. David Judd, a Nurse Practitioner (NP) in Clinton Township, Michigan, who practiced mental health treatment was convicted of operating such a scheme. As an NP, Judd had the authority to prescribe medication. <br/>
<h2>The Background </h2>
<p>
In September 2012, Judd formed Life Transition Services, Inc. as a “staffing services” company, eventually establishing an office in Clinton Township. Judd’s journey to becoming a Nurse Practitioner was a unique one, according to his attorneys. In their Sentencing Memorandum, they detailed his life:  </p>
<blockquote class=""text-color-option""><q>He grew up in a poor neighborhood in humble circumstances where he did have difficulties at home. As a young man, he found himself cutting meat as a profession. Sensing that this was not the career path he ultimately wanted to walk, Mr. Judd used the money he earned in the decade he worked at the meat cutting facility to put himself through community college and eventually graduated with a psychology degree from Oakland University.</q></blockquote>From there, he began a career in health care, first as a mental health technician at a hospital, and later working with elderly patients at a second hospital. In 1994, he obtained a degree in nursing and, in 2011, became an NP after completing the NP master’s program at Wayne State University.  <br/>
<h2>Judd’s Fraud Scheme </h2>
<a href=""https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mied.357036/gov.uscourts.mied.357036.56.0.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Prosecutors, in their overview of the case</a> presented during sentencing, described a different side of Judd, stating that Judd’s scheme (which ran from 2015 to 2021) was brazen: “Judd caused the submission of false and fraudulent claims to Medicare for psychotherapy services that were not medically necessary, not rendered and/or not eligible for Medicare reimbursement.”  <br/>
<br/>
According to a federal search warrant obtained in September 2021, Medicare data showed that Judd — and unlicensed social workers who worked for him — submitted numerous claims that exceeded the 24-hour clock. The analysis revealed that Judd submitted claims for 164 days between 2015 and November 2020, which were determined to be implausible. Medicare paid more than $525,000 for these submissions. <br/>
<br/>
For example, on May 12, 2018, Judd claimed to have seen 58 patients during that day and billed more than 45 hours in face-time with these patients. Similarly, on November 10, 2018, he saw 52 patients and billed for nearly 40 hours for that day. Judd also submitted claims for patients he allegedly saw when he was actually traveling out of state. <br/>
<br/>
One indicator, aside from the sheer incredibleness of the volume of hours and patients seen on a single day, were the notes in the electronic health records. These proved to be invaluable to the investigators, as they began compiling a pattern of impossible day billing. These reviews found that progress notes for claimed dates of service either did not exist or had been provided by ineligible providers, such as the social workers.  <br/>
<br/>
Health record progress notes showed that he had been claiming to see multiple patients during the same blocks of time, another impossibility. Finally, these progress notes also indicated that Judd had only conducted a routine 20-minute medication review and used the CPT 99213 but billed Medicare for an additional 30-minute psychotherapy session using CPT code 90833.  <br/>
<h2>The Outcome </h2>
Two days after the raid on his office, <a href=""https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mied.357036/gov.uscourts.mied.357036.56.0.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Judd was indicted</a> on four counts of health care fraud. Following some procedural motions, Judd ultimately pleaded guilty. In total, Judd submitted or caused to be submitted $1,248,519.94 in false and fraudulent claims to Medicare, resulting in payments of $605,701.30 because of Judd’s fraudulent acts.  <br/>
<h3>Other Examples of Impossible Day Schemes </h3>
<p>Judd is not the only example of impossible day fraud schemes. Insurance companies and government investigators have been very active in this space: </p>
<ul>
<li>In 2024, a <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/doctor-pay-nearly-700000-resolve-false-claims-act-allegations"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">New Jersey doctor settled False Claims Act (FCA) allegations</a> that included issues of impossible day billing.</li>
<li>A <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi/pr/hospitalist-companies-agree-pay-nearly-44-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations#:~:text=(defendants)%20have%20agreed%20to%20pay,one%20day%2C%20and%20billing%20for"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">hospital practice in Michigan settled a FCA investigation in 2023</a> that its doctors routinely billed over the 24-hour day.</li>
<li>A <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/nurse-practitioner-sentenced-192m-medicare-fraud-scheme"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Miami, Florida NP was sentenced to 20 years</a> in December 2023 for fraudulently billing Medicare for conducting complex office visits and routinely billed more than 24 hours in a single day.</li>
<li>A 2016 announcement by a <a href=""https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2016/07/16-07-06-nj-s-investigators-stay-ahead-of-multi-million-dollar-health-insurance-scams/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Special Investigations Unit in New Jersey</a> announced monies recovered and losses avoided in more than 900 cases, including some related to the impossible day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Health care investigators, auditors and leaders need to be attuned to this issue, setting controls to ensure that it cannot happen, or if someone does bill for an unreasonable daily amount, they are identified quickly. The Judd case is just one example of the work needed to detect and hold a provider accountable for the impossible day billing scheme. </p>

27,<h1>The Role of Risk Management Professionals in Fighting Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Risk management professionals are increasingly stepping into critical roles, serving as early warning systems and frontline defenders in the fight against fraud. </p>
<p>The field of fraud prevention extends beyond the traditional functions of auditors and investigators. Today's risk professionals, who bring analytical skills and strategic thinking together with cross-functional knowledge, are uniquely suited to detect vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. </p>
<h2>More Than Just Mitigating Risk </h2>
<p>
Risk management exists to protect an organization's future development. The essential responsibility of fraud detection and prevention naturally overlaps with risk management. Risk professionals who embed fraud considerations into risk assessments change the discussion from theoretical scenarios to current realities. </p>
<p>Risk managers help organizations construct protective measures that stop fraud schemes from developing through a proactive approach. For example, they protect organizational vulnerabilities by developing vendor risk frameworks and conducting third-party relationship assessments and financial stress tests to eliminate spaces where fraud can take place. </p>
<h2>Bridging Strategy and Oversight </h2>
<p>
Risk leaders maintain a broad perspective because they work across departments, which gives them an expanded view of operational activities and compliance requirements. Their reach allows them to detect warning signs, including reporting discrepancies and policy bypasses, as well as transactions that represent high risk — even when dedicated teams might not identify these issues earlier on. </p>
<p>Risk professionals possess special knowledge that allows them to form strong partnerships with internal audit, compliance and fraud examination departments. Their multidisciplinary approach allows them to detect both current threats and develop ongoing measures that support transparency and accountability throughout the organization. </p>
<h2>Strengthening Organizational Resilience </h2>
<p>
Organizations must view resilience as more than a buzzword, as it has become essential to protect against evolving fraud tactics. Risk professionals assist organizations in predicting the types of fraud that could emerge from internal factors or external ones, like economic declines, digital landscape changes or international tensions. As experts in identifying threats, they provide insights that often determine whether an incident stays limited to controlled measures or transforms into an expensive crisis. </p>
<h2>Where Risk Management Meets Fraud Prevention </h2>
Risk professionals bring essential skills to the anti-fraud field: data analysis, trend forecasting and crisis management. With additional training in fraud prevention and detection, their impact only grows. <br/>

<h2>The ACFE’s Report to the Nations </h2>
<p>The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) has conducted its global <em><a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/"">Report to the Nations</a></em> study 13 times since <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/report-to-the-nations-archive"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">1996</a> to calculate the impact of fraud and occupational abuse. Health care fraud has remained a steadfast leader in this area. In 2024, the median loss for health care fraud cases observed in the study was an astounding $100,000.  </p>
<p>While the median amount of loss has had its ups and downs over the years, likely due to the variation in cases encountered and submitted by Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs), what is more significant is the amount of the mean (or average) loss. Average losses have only been captured since 2014, but they provide a stunning depiction of the potential amount of fraud that impacts health care. The 2024 report shows that the average loss was nearly three-quarters of a million dollars ($721,000); in 2018, the average loss was $1.9 million per case. </p>
<p>Here is a summary of the median and mean losses in health care for the past few years: </p>

<h2>Federal Sentencing Statistics and How to Build a Case for Prosecution </h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.ussc.gov/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC)</a> publishes periodic reports on a variety of topics related to federal offenses. Of course, these cases are only those able to be fully investigated, prosecuted and adjudicated to sentencing—often a heavy lift given the limited resources of federal law enforcement and prosecutors. However, they give a glimpse into some of the most interesting pieces of data regarding health care fraud. <br/>
<br/>
In August 2024, the USSC published a <a href=""https://www.ussc.gov/research/quick-facts/health-care-fraud"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">summary of health care fraud cases</a> in the federal system. For fiscal year (FY) 2023, health care offenses constituted a 4.2% increase since FY 2019; FY 2023 saw 447 cases of health care fraud sentenced.  <br/>
<br/>
The USSC reported health care fraud median loss was $1,416,231, very similar to the amount figured in the 2020 <em>Report to the Nations</em> ($1.5 million). They noted that nearly 25% of the cases involved loss amounts of less than $250,000, while almost 5% were more than $9.5 million.   <br/>
<br/>
Key data points for fraud examiners to also consider are the factors that go into sentencing enhancements—the conduct that goes towards a higher sentence. For health care cases, these include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Conviction of a federal health care program offense (Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, CHAMPUS or the Veterans Health Administration) with a loss of more than $1 million. </li>
<li>Abusing a public position of trust or using a special skill (being a physician is typically a ‘special skill’ for purpose of this enhancement). </li>
<li>A leadership or supervisory role in the offense, typically involving co-conspirators or others, such as unwitting clinic or hospital staff. </li>
<li>The number of victims or the extent of harm to victims. </li>
<li>Using sophisticated means to execute or conceal the offense (including offshore transactions, multiple entities, etc.). </li>
</ul>
<p>Fraud examiners should always be alert to these types of enhancements, since they can be essential to securing a prosecutor’s interest in a criminal case, or additional conduct that would be relevant in civil litigation. </p>
<h2>False Claims &amp; Qui Tam Litigation </h2>
<p>During the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865), Congress found that price gouging and profiteering were prevalent, as were those who provided goods that were substandard. The False Claims Act (FCA) of 1863 targets fraud against government programs and includes a 'qui tam' provision, allowing private citizens to sue on behalf of the government and receive part of the settlement. The FCA has been updated and amended since its inception, but the specifics are beyond the scope of this article. Since 1987, the U.S. Justice Department has compiled statistics on FCA actions, judgments and settlements, and they share with those who filed the actions (called “relators”). <br/>
<br/>
The <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/false-claims-act-settlements-and-judgments-exceed-29b-fiscal-year-2024"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">statistics are updated yearly</a>, and for FY 2024, 85 new FCA health care fraud matters were filed (typically by the government itself), and another 370 health care FCA qui tam cases were filed. That amount is up from FY 2023, which had 349 new health care qui tam matters filed. Health-related qui tam cases also generated $1.2 billion in settlements and judgments in those cases where the federal government intervened (meaning they took over the case). Cases where the U.S. government declined to intervene generated settlements of $189 million for FY 2024.  <br/>
<br/>
Since 1987, the FCA has generated more than 11,000 cases with settlements of more than $54 billion in health care recoveries alone—a massive savings for taxpayers, allowing the recovery of ill-gotten gains by fraudsters.  </p>
<h2>Other Sources of Statistics </h2>
<p>Due to the sprawling nature of health care delivery, there are numerous sources of information that may be of interest to fraud examiners, especially those during fraud awareness presentations or training to staff, contractors and other professionals. These include: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.gao.gov/blog/federal-government-made-236-billion-improper-payments-last-fiscal-year"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Federal Government Made $236 billion “Improper Payments” Last Fiscal Year | U.S. GAO.</a> </li>
<li><a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2024/health-care-fraud-and-abuse-control-program-report-fiscal-year-2023/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program Report (Fiscal Year 2023). </a></li>
<li>HHS OIG’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2024/fall-2024-semiannual-report-to-congress/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Fall 2024 Semiannual Report to Congress.</a> </li>
<li><a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/?hhs-agency=MFCU&amp;issue-date=all#results"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) – State reports and inspections.</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>All of these figures, and many more, add to the growing picture of health care—and fraud—that CFEs, auditors, investigators and executives need to be mindful of when crafting anti-fraud programs, policies and cultures across the spectrum of care delivery and administration.</p>

29,<h1>Inspiring Future Fraud Investigators Through University Competitions</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Getting young professionals involved in fraud investigations early on is critical for the anti-fraud field to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated fraudulent crimes. The Fraud and Internal Control Case Competition (F1C3) at Drexel University addresses this challenge head on. This week-long annual competition creates a unique educational initiative designed to provide students with hands-on experience in fraud investigation and prevention.  <br/>
<br/>
Participating students get the opportunity to develop their skills in fraud investigation, then present their findings in a realistic, professional setting, preparing them for a bright future in the fraud-fighting profession.  <br/>
<h2>Competition Structure </h2>
The competition began with students receiving a case study designed by experienced anti-fraud professionals, which this year included ACFE Senior Research Specialist Laura Harris, CFE. Harris described the case study as a hypothetical corruption scenario involving a non-profit organization. Fifty-four students from six schools were assigned to teams and provided a coach who offered guidance while allowing the students to lead their own investigations into the case.  <br/>
<br/>
Throughout the week, teams dove into the case study, analyzing data, identifying potential anomalies and consulting with their peers. The investigation required students to think critically, work collaboratively and apply investigative techniques that mirror the real-world fraud investigation and detection process.  <br/>
<br/>
Teams presented their findings to a panel of judges across multiple rounds. They were evaluated, not only on the quality of their fraud investigation, but also on their presentation skills, professional appearance, public speaking abilities and overall analytical approach. While the main focus of the competition is for students to exercise their fraud-fighting skills, the platform allows students to build confidence and demonstrate their ability to properly and professionally present findings, as they would to future clients.  <br/>
<h2>Engaging the Next Generation of Fraud Fighters  </h2>
By embracing modern technological approaches, particularly allowing students to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) in their fraud detection efforts, the F1C3 event shows the important role that advanced technology plays in this field. The forward-thinking approach recognizes how today’s fraud investigators benefit from being technologically savvy and can use cutting-edge tools to uncover complex schemes. <br/>
<br/>
As part of the competition, students are also able to network with veteran anti-fraud professionals and learn skills that directly apply to what employers look for in internships, and even full-time positions, within the fraud prevention industry. These skills include data analysis, critical thinking, professional presentations, collaborative problem-solving, investigative techniques and overall resourcefulness. <br/>
<br/>
Seeing firsthand the impact this competition presented, Harris said, “I would have loved to have had this opportunity as a student, and I think every Certified Fraud Examiner can benefit from taking part, sharing their knowledge and encouraging the fraud fighters of the future.” <br/>
<br/>
While this unique setting offers immediate benefits, its impact extends much further. By cultivating a new generation of skilled, ethical and technologically adept fraud investigators, this competition contributes to broader efforts to prevent fraud and protect organizations at all levels. <br/>
<h2>How Other Universities Can Get Started </h2>
Careful planning and coordination are essential in creating a fraud investigation competition following the F1C3 model. The key to success lies in gathering a group of committed professionals who are passionate about providing exceptional student-led learning experiences.  <br/>
<h3>Steps for Implementing a Fraud-Fighting Competition: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Form a working group of educators or anti-fraud professionals who are willing to volunteer their time and knowledge. </li>
<li>Reach out to your local <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/community/chapters"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ACFE Chapter</a> or local anti-fraud professionals who can serve as potential mentors, judges or coaches.  </li>
<li>Collaborate with subject-matter experts in the anti-fraud field to write a foundational case study, potentially adapting an existing one. </li>
<li>Create a structure for students to conduct investigations with professional guidance. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Congratulations to the Winners </h2>
<p>The 2025 F1C3 competition showed exceptional talent and dedication from students across multiple universities. Teams from Drexel University and La Salle University demonstrated remarkable performances, taking home top marks in this year's competition.</p>
<p>This competition serves as a testament to the students’ hard work, critical thinking and potential in the field of fraud examination. Participating students not only gain valuable experience but also position themselves as promising future professionals in the anti-fraud field. </p>

                In December 2024, Attorney General of Pennsylvania Michelle Henry announced that a <a href=""https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/owner-of-montgomery-county-based-home-care-agency-and-19-others-charged-in-multi-million-dollar-medicaid-fraud-scheme/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">suburban Philadelphia-based home care agency, its owner and 18 other people</a> were charged in a scheme that allegedly defrauded the state Medicaid program out of millions of dollars. <br/>
<br/>
The allegations were that over a three-year period, ComfortZone Home Health Care, LLC, received reimbursed Medicaid funds to provide Personal Assistance Services (PAS) to eligible recipients. <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/medicare/medicaid-coordination/states/personal-care-services"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Medicaid defines PAS</a> as care and support “provided to eligible beneficiaries to help them stay in their own homes and communities rather than live in institutional settings, such as nursing homes.” However, as alleged, the owner, Stephanie Mobley and her co-conspirators simply submitted claims to the state for services that were never provided, then lied and covered it up. <br/>
<h2>Home Health: Independence and Mobility </h2>
As the average life expectancy continues to increase, so too does the need for care for the elderly and disabled. Many do not want to, or cannot afford to, live in a nursing home or assisted living facility unless absolutely necessary. Home health is a throw-back to the old “house calls” that doctors made up until the middle part of the 20th century.  <br/>
<br/>
Home health is also important from a cost perspective, since home health services are generally a less expensive alternative to hospitalization or skilled nursing facilities. <a href=""https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/home-health-services"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Medicare will cover many services</a> if a patient requires part-time or intermittent skilled nursing or is ""homebound,"" that is, having “significant difficulty leaving [their] home” and can cover a range of issues, including mobility, medical condition, frailness or otherwise is inadvisable or difficult. For home health, the care comes to the patient in the place they are most comfortable. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it can also be ripe for fraud. Fraudulent activity in home health often mirrors the schemes that take place in a hospital or clinical settings. One major issue is that there is often no one supervising the home health workers to ensure that the care is adequate, necessary and to standard—or if it ever occurs. In fact, the <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/documents/evaluation/9821/OEI-09-24-00200.pdf#xd_co_f=ZjcxODYzM2UtN2I0Yi00MjI4LThmMmMtNjIwYzE5Y2IyOGNm~"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">2023 Fiscal Year Report</a> for the state Medicaid Fraud Control Units showed that home health agencies were overwhelmingly the subjects of enforcement: 43 individuals were convicted of criminal charges, resulting in recoveries of more than $34.6 million and an additional 26 civil settlements totaling $15.6 million. <br/>
<h2>Recent Home Health Fraud Cases </h2>
In 2022, <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/carter-healthcare-affiliates-and-two-senior-managers-pay-7175-million-resolve-false-claims"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Carter Healthcare LLC</a>, an Oklahoma-based home health provider, and its affiliates, along with their top executives, agreed to pay $7.175 million to resolve False Claims Act allegations of Medicare fraud. According to the press release, the company allegedly billed the Medicare program knowingly and improperly for home health care to patients in Florida without regard to medical necessity and overbilled for therapy by upcoding patients’ diagnoses. The two men who controlled the company also agreed to a Corporate Integrity Agreement and a five-year exclusion from participating in federal health care programs. <br/>
<br/>
Following an earlier mistrial, <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/owner-home-health-care-company-convicted-multimillion-dollar-heath-care-fraud-scheme"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">a Massachusetts woman was convicted in July 2024</a> of health care fraud. From January 2013 to January 2017, the woman was a part owner and operator of Arbor Homecare Services LLC and conspired to use Arbor to defraud MassHealth of at least $100 million. She failed to train staff, billed for home health services that were never provided or were not medically necessary and services that were not authorized. The company, at the behest of the woman and her co-conspirators, paid kickbacks for patient referrals, entered sham employment relationships with patients’ family members to provide services that were not medically necessary and routinely billed for fictitious patient home visits. <br/>
<br/>
A Virginia woman who owned a business to provide Medicaid-funded home health and mental health care services <a href=""https://virginiabusiness.com/portsmouth-business-owner-pleads-guilty-to-1-3m-medicaid-fraud/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">pleaded guilty in August 2024</a> to one count of health care fraud and six counts of making false statements. The U.S. Attorney’s Office press release noted that she and her company “forged signatures of an [registered nurse] and fraudulently billed and received more than $50,000 from [the state]. Synergy billed and received from [the state] an additional $480,000 for patients for whom there was no documentation that any assessment had ever been done or while they were in the hospital or at other care settings.” Additionally, she inflated the time for billing for mental health services, making it appear that patients received more counseling than they actually had. <br/>
<h2>Bringing Them In: Patient Seekers </h2>
Another significant factor is the use of “patient marketers” or “beneficiary recruiters,” who seek potential home health participants to refer to providers. <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/home-health-care-company-owners-sentenced-67-million-health-care-fraud"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Patricia Omorogbe</a>, a Registered Nurse, and her husband owned several home health agencies in the Midwest. Between 2009 and 2018, the pair secretly paid bribes and kickbacks to patient marketers in exchange for referrals of Medicare beneficiaries to the companies. They used sham contracts and even engaged in an elaborate cash generation scheme to conceal payments to the marketers. The husband would write checks to himself and his employees, converting them to cash that was used to pay kickbacks. <br/>
<br/>
Patricia Omorogbe also caused fraudulent claims to be submitted to Medicare for home health services, claiming to perform medical assessments of patients on dates when she was out of the country. She also admitted that her companies would routinely admit, discharge and re-certify certain patients as needing home health care, regardless of whether they actually needed it or not. Patricia and her husband pleaded guilty; she received two years in prison, and he received 18 months. They had to re-pay $6.7 million. <br/>
<br/>
Following his indictment in 2015, a <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/international-fugitive-home-health-care-owner-sentenced-fraudulently-billing-medicare"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Michigan home health care company owner</a> fled to Canada and then flew to Pakistan, where he spent nearly eight years before returning to the U.S. to face the charges. Following his guilty plea, in November 2024, he received three years and five months in prison for a health care fraud conspiracy that resulted in almost $7.9 million in false and fraudulent claims for home health care services paid by Medicare. He and others offered kickbacks, bribes and inducements to beneficiary recruiters in exchange for Medicare beneficiary information. Using the patient’s information, they billed Medicare for services that either did not occur or were medically unnecessary.  <br/>
<h2>Red Flags of Fraud in Home Health Care </h2>
<p>Home health frauds represent significant challenges for auditors and CFEs. Identifying these schemes can be difficult, simply due to the lack of presence of an office or care facility other than the residence. Former Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Richard P. Kusserow, notes that <a href=""https://www.compliance.com/resources/home-health-is-among-the-most-vulnerable-programs-for-fraud/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">home health care schemes</a> are easy to exploit and hard to prove; they manipulate an especially vulnerable population who may be scared to report wrongdoing or negligence. He writes that “lack of training standards, uneven oversight of services provided, and failure to implement prepayment controls to prevent improper or fraudulent payments” often contribute to the problems and challenges of this type of fraud. Kusserow also offers some <a href=""https://www.compliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Web-Version-8th-February-Home-Health-Fraud-Red-Flags.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">indicators </a>to look for in home health schemes. <br/>
<br/>
<a href=""https://smpresource.org/medicare-fraud/fraud-schemes/home-health-care-fraud/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Senior Medicare Patrol</a>, a patient advocacy and fraud prevention organization supported by the Department of Health and Human Services, includes the following home health red flags: </p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolled in home health services by a doctor or other person the patient does not know. </li>
<li>Offered things such as “free” groceries or a “free” ride from a home health agency in exchange for their Medicare number (or to switch to a different home health agency). </li>
<li>Being charged a copayment or “fee” for home health services. </li>
<li>Being asked to sign forms verifying that home health services were provided even though the patient did not receive any medical services. </li>
<li>Offering cash or gifts in exchange for participating as a “caregiver” when none is needed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, a federal prosecutor who has worked many of these cases gave a <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/monitoring-programs/medicare-ffs-compliance-programs/pre-claim-review-initiatives/downloads/special-open-door-forum-on-home-health-fraud.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">presentation </a>that is worth reviewing if you encounter these types of cases; another <a href=""https://www.nyc.gov/html/hra/welfarefraudnyc/downloads/pdf/news/Presentation_01-09-13_Fraud_In_Personal_Care_Programs.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">briefing </a>from the New York City Department of Human Resources Administration describes some of the issues and indicators found in recent inspector general audits of home health and personal care.  <br/>
<br/>
The federal government <a href=""https://acl.gov/ltc/basic-needs/how-much-care-will-you-need"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">estimates that 69% of the population</a> will need some form of caregiving, whether in assisted living or skilled nursing facilities, or at home. 65% will likely need home care for about two years, according to the study—that is a population that could be very appealing to fraudsters.  </p>

31,<h1>The Importance of Mexican Companies Investigating and Sanctioning Misconduct</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Carlos Guerrero-Orozco </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>In recent years, attention has shifted towards the private sector’s involvement in combating corruption within companies and regarding third parties. It's more important than ever that companies and individuals actively participate in efforts to prevent and address corruption in their operations. This blog explores private sector companies’ obligations and responsibilities in Mexico towards the redefinition of business efficiencies and increase of value, as well as the role of international and foreign regulations that promote accountability from companies, their own managers and third parties. </p>
<h2>A History of Corruption</h2>
<p>Historically, Mexico's government has been viewed as victims of corruption in the country. The State has also served as the main prosecutors of illegal acts and central party to impose sanctions and fines, as well as freeze and recover assets. But what happens when no public official participates in the misconduct scheme? And what should be done when acts of corruption are perpetrated by two companies or individuals from the private sector?  </p>
<p>Corruption in the private sector occurs when individuals or organizations abuse their position of power for personal gain outside the scope of public office. Private-sector corruption could entail bribery to private agents, collusion to participate in private bids, or lack of identification of beneficial owners of a company, among other examples. This form of corruption is common in Mexican private companies and typically involves managers, employees, vendors or third parties involved in non-governmental business transactions.</p>
<p> In Mexico, according to a <a href=""https://contralacorrupcion.mx/encuesta-contra-la-corrupcion-en-el-sector-privado/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">survey </a>conducted by a Mexican non-profit and a confederation of employees, only 30% of companies have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy in place. Despite abusive practices in the private sector being considered common, private corruption is insufficiently addressed in most companies, and few sanctions against managers and employees could be accounted in the companies’ records.</p>
<h2>The Value of Compliance Programs</h2>
<p>Corporate compliance programs are critical tools in preventing corruption within private organizations. These programs typically include anti-bribery policies, conflict of interest regulations and internal reporting mechanisms designed to identify and address misconduct by a CFO, the head of operations, a manager or mid-level employee. Although the implementation of an internal program reassures shareholders and investors how resources are spent, prevents losses and reduces the directors' and managers' liability in an investigation, among other benefits, many companies fail to implement these programs. In many cases, compliance programs exist only as a formality, where company leadership can be absent and even negligent.  </p>
<p>It is essential for companies to recognize that internal compliance programs are not merely bureaucratic tools; they serve a vital purpose in safeguarding the company’s financial health and creating efficiencies in the long run. Compliance programs should also be seen as binding documents that apply to shareholders, employees and third parties, such as business partners and distributors.  </p>
<p>According to the <em><a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Occupational Fraud 2024: A Report to the Nations</a> </em>conducted by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), total losses due to fraud among 1,921 cases included in the study were calculated at $3.1 billion. As a result, it is estimated that organizations lose approximately 5% of revenue annually due to fraud. In the context of Latin America and the Caribbean, the situation becomes particularly alarming. Of 93 fraud cases analyzed from the region, there was a median loss of approximately $250,000 per case. This indicates that fraud in this region is both common and costly, affecting the viability of many organizations. The average duration of fraud in the region was approximately 16 months before detection, which is significantly longer compared to other areas of the world.</p>
<h2>Foreign Bribery Laws and Regulations</h2>
<p>Despite unique challenges in Mexico regarding private corruption, such as the lack of compliance evaluation mechanisms or the lack of strong regulation that offers better incentives than the reduction of sanctions in investigation procedures by Mexican authorities, the conversation leads towards the enforcement by companies of foreign anti-bribery laws and to the reparation of harms suffered as a consequence of private corruption. </p>
<p>Oftentimes, the enforcement of those foreign bribery laws is insufficient to most businesspersons in the country. Some companies do not recognize the benefits of designing and implementing a compliance program in accordance with international regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), or cannot attest if one of their operations will have a point of contact with these types of regulations. For example, private sector companies may not be actively aware of a business partner with U.S. citizenship, a distributor with operations across borders or a transaction in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Even without the link to U.S. regulation, those harmed by private corruption can pursue legal action to seek compensation for damages, including companies that have been harmed by their own managers or employees’ misconduct. In these cases, private companies, their shareholders and investors can demonstrate the economic harm caused by corrupt practices, such as the loss of income, increased costs in their business operations or lost value of shares. When the company is listed in the stock, institutional and retail investors play an important role in this reparation’s doctrine. </p>
<p>International treaties have offered a stronger framework for those business operations where foreign laws like FCPA or the U.K. Bribery Act could not be applicable. For example, the <a href=""https://www.unodc.org/corruption/en/uncac/learn-about-uncac.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">United Nations Convention Against Corruption</a> (UNCAC) sets clear obligations for states to ensure that victims of corruption have access to legal remedies, which extends to private companies. UNCAC specifically requires states to adopt measures allowing individuals or entities harmed by corruption to initiate legal action against the perpetrators. This international obligation provides a pathway for businesses and individuals to seek compensation for damages resulting from private corruption. By invoking international treaties in domestic courts, victims of corruption may gain access to justice — even in jurisdictions where national legislation is insufficient to address their claims. </p>
<p>Either invoking foreign laws, international treaties or national regulations, companies are entitled (and often constrained by regulations like U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) provisions) to hold accountable individuals who commit and profit from corporate misconduct, either internally or before public authorities with investigation and prosecutorial jurisdictions.</p>
<h2>Importance of Proactive Enforcement</h2>
<p>By proactively addressing internal wrongdoing, including investigating and sanctioning managers and employees, private companies strengthen their governance frameworks and demonstrate before their boards, shareholders, investors, employees and consumers a commitment to business efficiencies, financial growth, long-term business sustainability and competitiveness in global markets. </p>
<p>The fight against corruption and other types of misconduct is not the sole responsibility of governments and public institutions. Private sector companies play a critical role in preventing and addressing corruption, both within their organizations and in their dealings with third parties. To ensure accountability, companies must implement and enforce effective compliance programs, while legal frameworks must evolve to provide victims of private corruption with access to justice.  </p>
<p>International conventions, like the UNCAC, and foreign laws, like the FCPA, can offer valuable guidance for improving corporate accountability and promoting transparency in the private sector. By adhering to international standards and strengthening domestic laws, companies can contribute to a broader culture of integrity that benefits both the private and public sectors. <br/>

32,<h1>Spear Phishing in the Age of AI</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Samuel May,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                An evergreen avenue for fraud, phishing is a cyber security threat that has seen substantial evolution in recent years. While the threat of widespread phishing has grown, super charged by artificial intelligence (AI) tools and a world more connected than ever, spear phishing is especially dangerous to organizations and public targets. <br/>
<br/>
A standard phishing attack is a generic, seductive lure designed to entice the average person to click a link, download an attachment or otherwise compromise the security of their system. The attack is successful through volume; most recipients will not click it, but some will. The low effort required to produce the attack makes the low success rate acceptable and a good return on investment. This is especially true now, with widely available automation tools making writing and sending phishing attacks painfully easy.  <br/>
<h2>Modern Spear Phishing   </h2>
Spear phishing is the opposite. It is a targeted, tailored version of phishing. Spear phishing attacks are designed often for just a single individual or team within an organization. The purpose of the attack is also usually more specific than simply spreading malware. Targets are chosen for a high potential for monetary reward, to gain access to particularly sensitive systems, to hurt the reputation of a business or government, or for a variety of other malicious reasons.  <br/>
<br/>
Traditionally, spear phishing was a heavier lift. Perpetrators had to do their own research, manually combing through available information on the target to figure out how they should approach the attack. What kind of communications does the target typically receive? Who do they communicate with? Then, there was the actual communication. Attackers would need to draft an email or text that looked legitimate. Spelling errors, odd syntax or out of place idioms could raise suspicion and cause the attack to fail. If the attacker wanted to get the victim to download malware, they would typically need to create it themselves. It took particular individuals with the requisite skills and the necessary motivation to make all this extra effort.  <br/>
<br/>
Today's modern spear phishing utilizes new tools that make these attacks easier and more accessible. AI tools are getting stronger at putting together personalized attacks. A <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00586"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">study from 2024</a> evaluated the capability of large language model (LLM) AI tools in creating targeted spear phishing attacks. Specific AI models were tasked with gathering information and creating vulnerability profiles for specific targets. They created useful profiles 88% of the time and produced inaccurate profiles only 4% of the time. They also managed a 54% success ratio on fully AI-generated phishing emails, getting more than half of study participants to click links from the email. <br/>
<br/>
AI can also handle text message phishing attempts, generating authentic-looking answers rapidly enough to appear human in any language. Need to hook a victim who only trusts someone they can see? Deepfake video conferencing <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">has already shown itself to be successful</a>. <br/>
<h3>What does a spear phishing attempt look like in 2025? </h3>
The attempt will come from a source that does not seem out of place. The attacker will have done their research, whether alone or with the help of AI, and know what the victim wants or needs.  <br/>
<br/>
The communication will mimic real communications from other reputable sources. Everything is on the internet, including an almost infinite number of example memos, email templates and style guides. Attackers can sift through all of them faster than ever. <br/>
<br/>
The attacker will cover their bases and look legitimate. Most targets, especially valuable corporate targets, should know to be suspicious of emails from external sources thanks to cybersecurity training, and attackers know they will have to overcome a pretty substantial baseline suspicion. Whoever attackers claim to be in the email can be backed up with a social media presence filled with posts, pictures and potentially video appearing authentic.<br/>
<br/>
Overly motivated attackers will do what they can to attack a weakened defense. They might flood the victim’s inbox with easy-to-spot phishing emails or junk mail, creating a false sense of security and confidence in the victim’s ability to spot an attack. They can plan their attack for a particularly busy day, week or season, having identified times where the target is likely to be at their most haggard.  <br/>
<br/>
If the victim attempts to communicate with the attacker to verify their authenticity before fully biting the hook, they will find a courteous, professional, well-written individual. Text or direct messages through apps or social media will be responded to in short order with all appropriate pleasantries.  <br/>
<h2>The Plan in Action </h2>
<p>Our example victim is a successful online influencer. They have a YouTube channel with hundreds of thousands of subscribers and similar viewership across their media. As the attacker, we want to compromise their system and gain access to their YouTube account. If we are successful, we can contact hundreds of thousands of victims from a trusted source, spreading our chosen malware over a wide net. With our target picked, we just need to figure out what our spear phishing attack will look like.</p>
<p>Simple enough, let’s ask an AI. <br/>
<br/>
I prompted ChatGPT with: “What kind of email solicitations do YouTubers receive?” It immediately provided a list including sponsorship and brand deals, affiliate programs, free product offers and multi-channel (MCN) invitations. Let’s keep it easy and impersonate a potential sponsor.  <br/>
<br/>
Next step: ChatGPT again. Immediately after the first prompt, I asked: “What would a sponsorship email look like in this scenario?” Not the most elegant of prompts, perhaps, but it seemed to have worked: <br/>
<br/>
A sponsorship email can vary depending on the professionalism of the company, but here’s an example of a legitimate sponsorship email that a YouTuber might receive: </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><strong><em>Subject</em></strong><em><strong>: </strong>Exciting Sponsorship Opportunity with [Brand Name] <br/>
<br/>
Hi [YouTuber's Name], <br/>
<br/>
I hope you’re doing well! My name is [Your Name], and I work with [Brand Name], a company specializing in [industry/product type, e.g., gaming peripherals, skincare, software]. We’ve been following your YouTube channel and really love your content, especially [mention specific video or theme]. <br/>
<br/>
We think your audience would be a great fit for our product, [Product Name], and we’d love to explore a partnership with you. Here’s what we’re offering: <br/>
</em></p>
<ul style=""margin-left: 80px;"">
<li><em>A <strong>sponsored integration</strong> in one of your upcoming videos <br/>
</em></li>
<li><em>A <strong>competitive compensation package</strong> based on your audience size and engagement <br/>
</em></li>
<li><em>A <strong>custom discount code/affiliate program</strong> for your viewers (optional) <br/>
</em></li>
<li><em>We’ll provide a <strong>free product</strong> for you to test and review </em></li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><em>If you’re interested, we’d love to discuss further details, including payment terms and content expectations. Let me know your thoughts, and I’d be happy to set up a quick call or provide more details via email. <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to hearing from you! <br/>
<br/>
Best, <br/>
[Your Name] <br/>
[Brand Name] <br/>
[Your Position] <br/>
[Company Website] </em></p>
<p><em></em>ChatGPT was not done there, however. (Un?)Helpfully, at the end of this prompt, the AI threw in the following: </p>
<p><strong><em>🚩 Red Flags of a Scammy Sponsorship Email </em></strong><br/>
<em></em></p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Generic greeting</strong> (""Dear Sir/Madam"" instead of your actual name). <br/>
</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Poor grammar/spelling</strong> (legit brands have professional communication). <br/>
</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Unrealistic offers</strong> (e.g., thousands of dollars for a small channel). <br/>
</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Weird email address</strong> (e.g., random Gmail instead of an official domain). <br/>
</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Requests to download files or sign in</strong> (phishing attempts). <br/>
</em></li>
<li><em><strong>No clear details</strong> about what they expect from you. </em></li>
</ol>
<p>Great! We will be sure to avoid putting any of these red flags in our phishing attempt. <br/>
<br/>
Next, let’s decide what kind of sponsor we are. ChatGPT provided a list of potential companies: gaming peripherals, skincare and software. Gaming peripherals are easy enough; assuming we have no knowledge in this area, I asked ChatGPT: “What are the most popular gaming peripheral sponsors?” The list is too long to include here, but to be on the safe side, we will go with one of the companies further down on the list. Without putting in additional effort to figure out what sponsors the YouTuber already has, our chances are probably better with a less well-known brand. We will choose number eight on ChatGPT’s list, which was a provider of “gaming monitors, motherboards and graphics cards.”  <br/>
<br/>
The next step should be obvious. Ask ChatGPT: “Can you write an example sponsorship email from this company to [Influencer’s name] for a new gaming motherboard?”  <br/>
<br/>
All these prompts took less than five minutes to create. Another few minutes to review the draft and make sure none of those pesky “red flags of a scammy email” are present, and our phishing email is ready. <br/>
<br/>
The email could be finished and sent from a throwaway account without additional work. Maybe it catches the influencer on a bad day and they take the bait, responding to the email and initiating a conversation that the attacker ultimately steers toward following a link to a fake website or clicking a spoofed link to <a href=""https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/signing-contracts-with-docusign-watch-out-for-these-phishing-scams"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">sign a contract on DocuSign</a>.  <br/>
<br/>
If the attacker is motivated enough, there are additional, more involved steps they could take. Spoofing email addresses is more common than most people would like. Additional research, perhaps again helped by AI, on social media (LinkedIn, X, etc.) can reveal individuals with sponsorship responsibilities employed by a company. Instead of coming up with a good-enough fake name and email address, now an attacker has a real person to impersonate. Perhaps, just in case the target is particularly cautious, we will include a link to the employee’s social media accounts. If the potential reward is substantial enough, the attacker can spend time copying the entire X (formerly Twitter) account of this employee and pay for “verification” on the X platform, providing a link to the fake account in their phishing email. If the target takes the time to verify the attacker’s fake identity and reach out on X, they will find an account, a picture and maybe even some posts. The attacker will be able to respond to X messages sent to the fake account and keep the charade going. Add in a deep faked teleconference, and who wouldn’t click a link to sign a contract for a big payday? <br/>
<br/>
Now, imagine the target is someone at your organization. What kinds of real emails do they see every day? Maybe ChatGPT’s answer is not as clear as our example above, so the attacker is forced to pivot. Instead of working off the person’s occupation, the attacker can go to social media, identifying what the actual individual desires. Perhaps they have one too many posts about their gardening or photography hobby. ""Hey ChatGPT, what kinds of emails would a gardener be interested in? What would a “seasonal gardening guide” email look like? What would a trustworthy source be for seasonal gardening guides?"" Next thing you know, a hobbyist gardener who manages database access for your organization receives an email from the American Horticultural Society with an enticing link to a guide specifically created for her hardiness zone.</p>
<h2>Playing Defense </h2>
<p>Fortunately, some of the tools phishers use are also being implemented to help defend against these targeted attacks. Automated tools are scouring emails for dodgy links and just-not-quite-right email addresses, but they will never be fully successful at keeping them out of our collective inboxes. </p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to each and every individual to maintain constant, at times exhausting, vigilance against phishing attempts. It is especially important to avoid being lulled into feeling secure because we have become adept at spotting typos or translation errors, or hovering over links to reveal unrecognizable spaghetti, in our texts and emails. Attackers are better equipped to make fewer mistakes and figure out what shiny lure to dangle to get us to drop our guard. </p>

                In October 1972, the U.S. Congress <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/93/statute/STATUTE-87/STATUTE-87-Pg152.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">passed landmark legislation</a> that, for the first time, criminalized the use of kickbacks and bribes in health care as misdemeanors. <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/95/statute/STATUTE-91/STATUTE-91-Pg1175.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Five years later, Congress upgraded the crimes to felonies</a>, demonstrating the serious nature of the threat to public safety and health that unrestrained greed could have on the medical system. Since then, the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) has been a bedrock for ensuring that the health care system is void of any improper arrangements and incentives that could jeopardize the health and safety of patients. <br/>
<br/>
Health care kickbacks can lead to detrimental consequences for physicians, patients and those involved in the scheme. Overutilization of services may occur, leading to unnecessary medical procedures and treatments. Program costs can increase significantly due to these illicit practices. Through kickback schemes, medical decision-making can become corrupted, as financial incentives can influence treatment choices rather than patient needs. Kickbacks form a secretive, unfair competitive health care environment, creating an imbalanced market.  <br/>
<h2>What is a Kickback?  </h2>
<a href=""https://www.oed.com/dictionary/kickback_n?tl=true&amp;tab=factsheet"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Oxford English Dictionary</a> defines kickback as “a payment made to someone who has facilitated a transaction or appointment, especially illicitly.” The <a href=""https://www.etymonline.com/word/kickback"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> indicates that in the mid-1920s, the word became a slang version describing illegal payoffs. Given public concerns about the widespread influence of organized crime and government corruption during that time, kickback became synonymous with underhanded financial activity. <br/>
<h2>Kickbacks in the Medical Industry </h2>
According to the <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/physician-education/fraud-abuse-laws/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General</a> (HHS OIG), “the AKS is a criminal law that prohibits the knowing and willful payment of ""remuneration"" to induce or reward patient referrals or the generation of business involving any item or service payable by the Federal health care programs.”  <br/>
<br/>
It's a broad and expansive law that has important implications for fraud examiners and auditors. At the heart of the statute is the idea of patient referrals—a form a <em>quid pro quo</em>. If Dr. X refers patients to Lab Y, and Lab Y pays Dr. X in cash for each patient seen by the lab, which is a kickback.  <br/>
<br/>
Liability for kickbacks are severe: those who offer, solicit or receive kickbacks for patient referrals are subject to stiff fines, lengthy jail terms and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded programs. The financial ramifications include a $50,000 per kickback penalty, as well as treble damages (three times the amount of the kickback itself). In addition, <a href=""https://www.lowenstein.com/news-insights/publications/articles/updated-a-survey-of-health-care-anti-kickback-law-at-the-state-level-mcbride-moseson-schindler-terry"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">state laws</a> prohibiting similar conduct may be implicated as well, triggering additional sanctions. <br/>
<br/>
There are <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/safe-harbor-regulations/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">“Safe Harbor” provisions</a> that protect certain payment and business practices that could otherwise implicate the AKS; these address personal services and rental agreements, investments in ambulatory surgical centers and payments to <em>bona fide</em> employees but are beyond the scope of this article.  <br/>
<h2>Case Studies in Kickbacks  </h2>
<p>Kickbacks are disguised payments and can be hidden easily, much like other fraudulent activity, in the books and records of a medical practice, provider or ancillary service. Some recent examples may be helpful. </p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/california-man-admits-role-10-million-health-care-kickback-scheme"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">January 2025, a California man admitted to paying kickbacks</a> in connection with a genetic cancer testing regime. The man, who owned and controlled marketing companies, identified Medicare beneficiaries that may be interested in the testing. The man’s company provided personal and medical information for these Medicare beneficiaries to the cancer testing companies, who sent them out to the individuals. Once the tests were completed and returned, other participants in the scheme submitted claims to Medicare for reimbursement—who then paid kickbacks ranging from $1,700 to $2,000 for each test. By using offshore shell companies, sham transactions and circuitous wire transfers between entities, the man and his conspirators were able to conceal a $10 million loss to taxpayers.    </li>
<li>A <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-pr/pr/mmm-holdings-llc-agrees-pay-152-million-dollars-resolve-allegations-it-violated-false"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">company in Puerto Rico settled allegations of kickbacks</a> by agreeing to pay a fine of $15.2 million. In this scheme, the company allegedly provided gift cards to administrative assistants of medical providers to stimulate their referrals to enroll thousands of Medicare beneficiaries in the company’s Medicare Advantage plan. The company entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with HHS OIG, taking specific steps for internal control, monitoring and identification of potential misconduct going forward.  </li>
<li>The <a href=""https://www.oig.dol.gov/public/Press%20Releases/Man%20Sentenced%20for%2087M%20Healthcare%20Fraud%20Kickback%20Conspiracy_DOJ-OPA.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">owner of a Chicago-based durable medical equipment (DME) company</a> was convicted after a jury trial for defrauding multiple federal health care programs through the illicit use of kickbacks to identify and secure patients for DME equipment. Between 2015 and 2018, the owner illegally acquired patient information through multiple individuals with access to medical histories and information. The group employed deceptive tactics, including tricking patients into agreeing to receive unnecessary or unwanted DME, as well as resorting to aggressive and persistent methods, such as repeated phone calls and faxes to pressure doctors into signing prescriptions for the DME. The scheme participants submitted approximately $87 million in false claims to Medicare, ultimately receiving $23.6 million in fraudulent payments. The owner received a prison sentence of three years, as well as forfeiture of $1.8 million.  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Kickbacks </h2>
<p>Like other corruption schemes, kickbacks come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They can be subtle or obvious, simple or complex, as the examples above indicate. In <a href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/blogs/healthlawscan/2023/08/texas-attorney-convicted-of-conspiracy-with-clients-to-commit-healthcare-fraud"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">one case</a>, a lawyer created sham trusts and shell corporations through which he laundered at least $2.7 million in health care kickback proceeds through his law firm’s Interest on Lawyers Trust Account (IOLTA), operating account and a personal bank account to launder and transmit the kickback proceeds to others in the scheme.  </p>
<p>Kickbacks may be discussed as “code words” or other language that is intended to camouflage the true purpose. Forms of kickbacks that auditors and CFEs may encounter include: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lavish expenses:</strong> Covering the cost of expensive meals, drinks, luxurious hotel stays and air travel, including improperly paying for continuing medical education or conference attendance. </li>
<li><strong>Tangible or monetary benefits:</strong> Providing gifts, favors or other items of value, directly to the physician or indirectly to their spouse, children or business associate. </li>
<li><strong>Business-related kickbacks:</strong> Offering incentives such as “rebates,” free or deeply discounted rent, advertising space or other seemingly legitimate business benefits, typically well below fair market value. </li>
<li><strong>Disguised payments:</strong> Concealing illicit payments as legitimate transactions for goods or services that were never actually provided, including DME, pharmaceutical products, lab tests and others. </li>
</ul>
<p>Improperly inducing referrals through illicit payments is a crime that hurts patients and drives up the cost of health care. While many industries use gifts and other benefits to bring in business, in health care the stakes are too high. The <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-co/pr/2-million-resolves-kickback-allegations-relating-denver-neuromonitoring-company"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Attorney’s Office in Colorado</a> summarized why deterring and holding accountable those who participate in this misconduct is so important for healthy communities and proper caregiving: “The Anti-Kickback Statute is intended to ensure that medical providers’ judgments are not compromised by improper financial incentives and are instead based on the best interests of their patients.”  </p>

34,<h1>AI and Fraud Detection: Insights from ACFE Research Institute Grant Recipient </h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Fraud detection is a critical yet challenging aspect of auditing and financial oversight. With the support of the <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/about-the-acfe/acfe-foundation/acfe-research-institute"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ACFE Research Institute</a>, researchers are working to uncover insights that can enhance fraud prevention and risk assessment.</p>
<p>In this interview, we speak with Ivy Munoko, an assistant professor at the Fisher School of Accounting, Warrington College of Business, University of Florida, about her research under the ACFE data access grant. Alongside her colleagues, she is investigating the characteristics that influence auditors' ability to detect fraud, as well as the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in corporate fraud detection. Through her work, she aims to provide valuable insights for regulators, auditors and fraud examiners navigating an increasingly complex landscape. </p>
<h2>What is the focus of your current research under the ACFE Research Institute grant? </h2>
<p>
Our research, supported by the ACFE data access grant in 2024, examines the characteristics associated with the successful detection of fraud through audit mechanisms. The ACFE estimates that external auditors detect only <a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/"">3% of frauds</a>. Furthermore, only 9% of frauds discovered by other parties (e.g., management and internal auditors) are brought to the attention of external auditors. Our research examines what audit client and environmental factors are associated with auditors' successful fraud detection, which would be informative to regulators and the audit profession. I am conducting this research with my colleagues, Syrena Shirley, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, and Triza Nganga, Ph.D. candidate at the University of Texas at Arlington. </p>
<p>A second research project, supported by the ACFE Research Institute grant in 2023, evaluates the net benefit of using AI (large language models and machine learning models) in detecting corporate fraud by analyzing a large dataset of corporate managers' discussions on their firm's financial performance. The research publication is currently under journal review. I conducted this research with Helen Brown-Liburd and Soohyun Cho, both associate professors at Rutgers Business School. </p>
<h2>How do you believe your research will contribute to the field of fraud examination and prevention? </h2>
The findings from our studies highlight that detecting fraud risk factors and events is complex, requiring a multipronged approach that considers the organizational context and temporal changes in corporate communication. The studies also highlight the complexity of detecting fraud risk and demonstrate the potential to enhance auditors' detection of fraud risk by incorporating advanced technology. 
<h2>What are some of the biggest challenges you have faced in your research? </h2>
<p>
It is hard to obtain a comprehensive fraud dataset to address our research questions effectively. As a research team, we are very grateful to the ACFE for the rigorous and consistent data collection over two decades that enables us to understand this phenomenon better. Also, obtaining access to professionals to participate in our studies is often challenging. Through the online <a href=""https://connect.acfe.com/home"">ACFE Community</a> and during the <em>ACFE Global Fraud Conference</em>, we met professionals who participated in our studies and provided us with valuable insights.</p>
<p>My connection to the ACFE is one of my most valued professional relationships, significantly informing my research. I am especially thankful to Kip Holderness, professor at West Virginia University and the ACFE Research Institute director of research; Mason Wilder, research director at the ACFE; Andi McNeal, chief training officer at the ACFE; and Yasmin Hoffmann, educational production director at the ACFE, who have all been instrumental to our research. 
</p>
<h2>What do you believe are the practical implications of your research for fraud examiners? </h2>
Our research findings from studies supported by the ACFE point to the difficulty of detecting fraud, specifically in large organizations. Our research shows that analyzing corporate communication provides useful signals of fraud. However, it may be difficult for auditors to review corporate communication manually due to time and resource constraints and the typical volume of corporate communication. Our study documents the capability of language models to automate preliminary risk assessments using public and private corporate communication, which are typically accessible to auditors.  <br/>
<h2>What advice would you give fraud examiners and researchers interested in applying for an ACFE Research Institute grant? </h2>
Start with a research question that is important and interesting to you. Share this research with your trusted colleagues to get their feedback. This will help you refine your research question and find potential collaborators. You may be tempted to keep finetuning your idea until it's perfect, but as the deadline approaches, do not hesitate to submit your proposal, imperfect as it may be. Ultimately, I believe an informative and practical research idea is the key to obtaining grants.

35,<h1>The Language of Health Care: A Key Tool in Fraud Examinations</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Colin May,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Health care is a <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240086746#:~:text=The%20report%20shows%20that%20global%20spending%20on%20health,driven%20by%20higher%20government%20spending%20and%20out-of-pocket%20spending."" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">$9.8 trillion business</a>, according to the <a href=""https://apps.who.int/nha/database"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">World Health Organization</a>. In the U.S., according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, health care is a <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/national-health-expenditures-2022-highlights"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">$4.5 trillion business</a>. Estimates of fraud in U.S. health care range widely, with one <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/how-medicare-and-medicaid-fraud-became-a-100b-problem-for-the-us.html?msockid=189f19abf6d060b7364b0cfcf7af61f0"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">recent estimate being around $100 billion</a>. Whichever way you analyze it, the losses and potential losses from fraud in health care are substantial. <br/>
<h2>Know the Terminology </h2>
For fraud examiners seeking to better understand the health care system and its complexity, it is important to appreciate the language that medical professionals use to get paid, and the systems, platforms and terms associated with the health care ecosystem. Definitions are crucial to understanding the landscape and making sense of key terms and their meaning.  <br/>
<br/>
Since health care fraud is one of the largest fraudulent activities, Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs) and fraud auditors who are not well versed in the health care industry can access multiple glossaries available on the internet to help them decipher information. You do not need to be a nurse or doctor to understand the business flow of a medical practice, but as all good auditors and fraud examiners know, it is essential to document how things actually occur as opposed to what the policy manual states—if there is one. Identifying and drilling down into gaps in policy, procedure and practice are critical to the discovery and remediation of fraud and misconduct.  <br/>
<h2>The Business of Health </h2>
<p>One of the most comprehensive glossaries is found at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), under the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation: <a href=""https://aspe.hhs.gov/glossary-terms"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Glossary of Terms | ASPE</a>. The primary emphasis is on words associated with aging, disability or long-term care, but the list is extensive and incredibly useful for a variety of health care-related issues. Similarly, <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">healthcare.gov</a> has another <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/sbc-glossary/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Glossary of Health Coverage and Medical Terms</a> that will be useful for a CFE working on these types of cases. <br/>
<br/>
The <a href=""https://www.mgma.com/practice-ops-demographic-filter-definitions"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Practice Operations Glossary</a> from the Medical Group Management Association is a useful tool to appreciate how medical practices operate from a business perspective. They include key terms like Total Medical Revenue and types of legal organizations. There is a separate <a href=""https://www.mgma.com/management-staff-geographic-section"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Management and Staff Glossary</a> that helps breakdown types of employees, geographic locations and types of specialties. <br/>
<br/>
At Doctors Management, they collected a variety of clinical and business terms in their <a href=""https://www.doctorsmanagement.com/glossary-of-terms/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Glossary of Terms</a> that include HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) Compliance, managed care, occupational health and safety, and others. <br/>
<br/>
Many providers, in helping their patients navigate the billing process, also provide terms and information about health care that can benefit fraud examiners. For example, the University of Washington Medicine published this <a href=""https://www.uwmedicine.org/patient-resources/billing-and-insurance/glossary"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Glossary of Billing and Insurance Terms</a> to aid in patients interpreting their bills. <br/>
<br/>
Financial Recovery Group, a company specializing in health care information technology, created a glossary specifically dedicated to the issues of health care finance: <a href=""https://frgsystems.com/healthcare-finance-news/glossary-of-medical-billing-and-coding-terminology"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Glossary of Medical Billing and Coding Terminology</a>. Others, like professors at colleges or universities, have also done the same, like one from Dr. Marian Powers posted online at the University of Kansas Medical Center: <a href=""https://www.kumc.edu/documents/anes/Accounting%20Glossary%20for%20ASA%20-%20Powers-Sep2018.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Accounting Glossary for ASA</a>.<br/>

</ul>
<h2>Going Deeper </h2>
<p>Medical care is getting more and more complex—largely due to a massive increase in specializations and sub-specialties, which have their own language, too. If you are working a case on an oncologist, audiologist or a durable medical equipment provider, it would be important to identify those specialty-specific jargon. Below are some examples: </p>
<ul>
<li>Clinical research terms: <a href=""https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/nia-glossary-clinical-research-terms"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">NIA Glossary of Clinical Research Terms | National Institute on Aging </a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Finding More Resources </h2>
Local public and university libraries also have excellent resources in their holdings that can be useful in a health care fraud examination. Many local libraries also have access to national databases that could provide additional information and context that a CFE would find beneficial during an engagement. Used book sellers, both physical and online, should not be overlooked for low-cost publications. <br/>
<br/>
Open-source books by reputable professionals, like university professors, will also come in handy. For example, two University of West Florida instructors have published the “<a href=""https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/1147"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Medical Terminology for Healthcare Professions</a>.” <br/>
<h2>Applications in Real Life </h2>
<p>
Terms and their definitions are not just for the theoretical understanding of a situation but can be employed during a fraud examination or investigation in a variety of ways. Some instances include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Using terms to test the accuracy of your understanding—or the interviewee’s. (e.g., What is an adenoidectomy, Dr. Smith? What does it mean? Help me understand what [term] consists of…) </li>
<li>Define the terms for a lay audience, such as a prosecutor or attorney, if they do not specialize in medical or health care fraud. (e.g., Palliative care is defined as medical care focused on improving quality of life for people with serious illnesses and their care partners by the National Institute of Health…) </li>
<li>Explaining the term and its usage in a presentation, trial testimony or investigative report so that it sets the conduct into its proper context. (e.g., Palliative care and hospice care are often intertwined; according to the National Institute of Health, hospice care only occurs at the end of someone’s life, while palliative care can be done anytime during a serious illness, regardless of its terminal nature…) </li>
</ul>
<p>
Music is a universal language—a cellist does not need to know the trumpeter’s native language to be able to play the instruments together. Much like an orchestra, it is important for fraud examiners, investigators and auditors to be on the same page, especially when dealing with the complexity and depth of health care. Comprehending the terms, acronyms and jargon of the healing profession is vital to be able to accurately and adequately conduct a fraud examination in this industry.   </p>

37,<h1>Communicating AI Risks to Employees — And Why Now is the Time to Get Started</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms continues to reshape the business landscape. While many organizations are still adjusting to AI-driven risks introduced by industry leaders like OpenAI and Google, a new wave of AI tools like DeepSeek presents fresh challenges that organizations must address. <br/>
<h2>The Emergence of DeepSeek and What It Means for Businesses </h2>
<a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-ai-china-privacy-data/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">DeepSeek</a>, a Chinese AI startup, recently made headlines for its powerful new language model. Like ChatGPT and Claude, DeepSeek promises advanced AI capabilities, but its privacy practices have raised significant concerns. Reports indicate that the platform collects keystroke data and routes information through Chinese servers, sparking worries about data security and regulatory compliance. <br/>
<br/>
This is not an isolated case. The proliferation of AI startups means that new GenAI tools and updates are rapidly launching, often without the robust security and ethical frameworks that larger established providers have in place. This introduces new risks that employees, often eager to try the latest and greatest AI tools, may not fully understand. <br/>
<h2>Why AI Risks Are Just Getting Started </h2>
The financial and fraud-related risks of AI misuse are well-documented, with a recent warning from Wall Street regulators highlighting how <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/genai-increasingly-powering-scams-wall-street-watchdog-warns-a6592d54?mod=djemRiskCompliance"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">GenAI is increasingly being exploited in scams and financial fraud</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Fraudsters are leveraging AI to create highly convincing phishing attacks, deepfake videos and synthetic identities, often with minimal effort. Organizations need to recognize that just because an AI platform is new doesn’t mean it’s any safer than previous iterations. In fact, newer models may introduce even more risks due to looser regulatory oversight and a lack of transparency regarding data handling. <br/>
<h2>The Importance of Proactive Employee Communication </h2>
With AI risks evolving rapidly, organizations must act now to educate employees. Employees may not intentionally put sensitive company data at risk. but without clear guidelines, uploading proprietary information to AI chatbots, sharing confidential details through unsecured tools or falling victim to AI-powered fraud schemes opens up organizations to potential harm. <br/>
<h3>To mitigate these risks, organizations should: </h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Educate employees on AI risks:</strong> Regular training on AI security, privacy and fraud risks should be an integral part of workplace education. </li>
<li><strong>Establish clear AI usage policies:</strong> Employees need to understand which AI tools are approved, what data can be shared and the consequences of misusing these tools. </li>
<li><strong>Monitor for AI-driven fraud threats:</strong> Organizations should stay informed about the latest AI fraud schemes and ensure employees are aware of evolving tactics. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparing Employees for Change </h2>
For organizations looking to strengthen their fraud risk management strategies, the ACFE’s <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/employee-fraud-awareness-training"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Employee Fraud Awareness Training program</a> provides a structured approach to educating employees on fraud risks, ethical decision-making and compliance issues. As AI-powered fraud techniques become more sophisticated, organizations that invest in employee awareness today will be better equipped to mitigate future risks. <br/>
<br/>
The emergence of DeepSeek and other next-generation AI platforms underscores the urgency of addressing AI risks now. Employees are the first line of defense against AI-driven fraud but without the right guidance, they can also be a point of vulnerability. Organizations that take proactive steps through education, policies and structured training will be better prepared to navigate the challenges posed by AI in the years ahead.

38,<h1>The Evolution of Government Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Laura Harris,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                The first ACFE <em><a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/report-to-the-nations-archive"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Report to the Nations</a></em> was published nearly 30 years ago in <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/files/acfe/pdfs/1996-rttn.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">1996</a>. It would be overly simplistic to say that fraud has grown since then, but the data clearly shows significant increases as more information has been reported by Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs) around the world. Over nearly three decades, the <em>Report to the Nations</em> has evolved into a comprehensive study that considers a multitude of fraud-related factors. It is not enough to ask “who” or “how” — the report has consistently sought to ask all the questions it can to learn from past fraud cases. Looking back at the past reveals some powerful insights.  <br/>
<h2>Government Organizational Type: Median Loss </h2>
<p>
For example, from 2002 to 2024, the median loss of a fraud case of a government organization victim tripled.  In 2002, when the second report was published, government victim organizations experienced a median loss of $48,000. By 2024, the 13th iteration of the report estimated median losses at $150,000. Other victim organization classifications included public and private companies and not-for-profit organizations.  </p>
<p>
<img alt=""Insights- Gov Fraud Graph #1"" src=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/images/acfe/blog/insights-gov-fraud-graph-1.png?h=241.545&amp;w=626&amp;hash=47BD513D9C91D9E5607BCA3ED81D69F7"" style=""height: 241.545px; width: 626px; left: 592.997px;""/></p>
<p><em>Data compiled from the ACFE's </em>Report to the Nations<em>, 2002–2024.</em></p>
<h2>Government as an Industry: Median Loss </h2>
<p>In addition to being analyzed as an organizational type, government is also classified as an industry within the report, alongside public administration. Starting in 2004, the report began to analyze the median losses by industry, where government agencies and public administration experienced a median loss of $45,000.  Over the next 20 years, these losses steadily increased, reaching a median of $200,000 in the 2024 report.  </p>
<p>
<img alt=""Insights- Gov Fraud Graph #2"" src=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/images/acfe/blog/insights-gov-fraud-graph-2.png?h=291.909&amp;w=629.909&amp;hash=0B1DCE0B0EDB7F057507715311E1C7BD"" style=""height: 291.909px; width: 629.909px; top: 553.423px;""/></p>
<p><em>Data compiled from the ACFE's </em>Report to the Nations<em>, 2004–2024.</em></p>
<h2>Corruption Cases by Industry  </h2>
<p>When analyzing government agencies and public administration as victim industries, corruption cases within the government have nearly doubled. In 2006, corruption cases accounted for approximately 26.1% of the cases, but by 2024, 52% of reported cases involved corruption.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Insights- Gov Fraud Graph #3"" src=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/images/acfe/blog/insights-gov-fraud-graph-3.png"" style=""height: 336.727px; width: 636.091px; top: 1123.41px;""/></p>
<p><em>Data compiled from the ACFE's </em>Report to the Nations<em>, 2006–2024.</em></p>
<p>Corruption often exists in concert with other fraud schemes yet is a separate branch of the Fraud Tree. Total corruption cases have increased over time. Demonstrated below, the past ten years have shown that government fraud has a higher percentage of corruption than an average case.  </p>
<p>
 <img alt=""Insights- Gov Fraud Graph #4"" src=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/images/acfe/blog/insights-gov-fraud-graph-4.png?h=369.091&amp;w=635&amp;hash=2056D58710A358477053DB641F6045CA"" style=""height: 369.091px; width: 635px; top: 1397.94px;""/></p>
<p><em>Data compiled from the ACFE's </em>Report to the Nations<em>, 2006–2024.</em></p>
<h2>A Broader Perspective </h2>
<p>If fraud is increasing everywhere, it stands to reason that corruption, and median losses, are increasing in government fraud cases as well. Fraud and fraud opportunities are nearly everywhere. </p>
<p>One cannot help but ask: is more fraud occurring, or are we just uncovering more than before? Yes. Fraud perpetrators, schemes and opportunities are all increasing, and in turn, the reporting also increases.  </p>
<p>In 1996, the<a href=""https://press.un.org/en/1996/19961114.pop626.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> world population</a> was just less than 6 billion and <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/UN-projects-world-population-to-peak-within-this-century"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">estimates </a>of the world population in 2024 approximate more than 8 billion. With projections of the population expected to peak before the turn of the century, it is only logical to assume that fraud’s cyber manifest destiny will continue.   </p>

39,<h1>The Power of Forensic Accountants in Uncovering Fraud and Protecting Organizations </h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Fraud can infiltrate even the most secure organizations, leaving a trail of financial and reputational damage in its wake. When fraud arises, forensic accountants play a critical role in uncovering the truth, guiding investigations and safeguarding organizational integrity. These professionals are the financial detectives who combine their expertise in accounting, investigative skills and legal acumen to uncover fraud schemes, quantify damages and provide valuable insights to stakeholders. <br/>
<h2>Investigative Expertise That Drives Results </h2>
Forensic accountants possess a unique skill set that allows them to delve deep into financial records and identify irregularities that others might miss. Their work often involves tracing transactions, analyzing complex financial data and identifying discrepancies that may signal fraudulent activity. Whether uncovering embezzlement, financial statement fraud or asset misappropriation, forensic accountants bring precision and objectivity to each investigation. <br/>
<br/>
For example, a forensic accountant might investigate a sudden spike in vendor payments within a company's accounts payable system. Through meticulous analysis, they could uncover a fraudulent scheme involving a shell company, revealing how an employee funneled funds into a personal account. Their ability to follow the money trail provides organizations with actionable evidence and ensures that fraudsters are held accountable. <br/>
<h2>Forensic Accountants' Key Role in Investigations </h2>
When fraud is suspected, forensic accountants often lead the charge in uncovering the truth. Their investigative role varies by case but typically includes: <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Data Gathering and Analysis</strong>: Forensic accountants excel at gathering and scrutinizing financial data to uncover anomalies and irregularities. They leverage specialized tools such as forensic data analytics software, accounting platforms and data visualization tools to identify patterns, outliers and suspicious trends. This meticulous approach ensures that no stone is left unturned during the investigation. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Collaboration with Legal Teams</strong>: Forensic accountants frequently work alongside legal teams to ensure evidence is collected, preserved and presented in a manner admissible in court. Their collaboration bridges the gap between financial investigations and legal requirements, ensuring a seamless transition from detection to prosecution. <br/>
<h2>Bridging the Gap Between Finance and Law </h2>
Forensic accountants are not only financial experts but also adept at understanding legal procedures and requirements. Their work often intersects with law enforcement, legal teams and regulatory bodies. This dual expertise makes them invaluable in preparing evidence for court, testifying as expert witnesses and ensuring that investigations comply with legal standards. <br/>
<br/>
Consider a forensic accountant involved in a high-profile fraud case. Their testimony, backed by thorough financial analysis and documentation, can strengthen a prosecutor’s argument and help secure a conviction. This ability to bridge finance and law underscores the importance of forensic accountants in both preventing and responding to fraud. <br/>
<h2>Proactive Measures to Protect Organizations</h2>
Beyond investigating fraud, forensic accountants play a proactive role in strengthening organizational defenses against fraud. By assessing risk, reviewing internal controls and providing recommendations for improvement, they help organizations build robust systems to deter fraudulent activity. <br/>
<br/>
Forensic accountants often work closely with leadership to identify vulnerabilities within financial processes. They may suggest implementing tighter controls over expense approvals, introducing regular audits or leveraging technology to monitor transactions for suspicious activity. These proactive measures not only reduce the likelihood of fraud but also create a culture of accountability and transparency. <br/>
<br/>
Forensic accountants are essential allies in the fight against fraud. Their investigative expertise, legal knowledge and proactive strategies empower organizations to uncover fraud, recover losses and prevent future incidents. By shining a light on financial wrongdoing and championing ethical practices, forensic accountants help protect businesses, stakeholders and the broader financial ecosystem. <br/>

40,<h1>Greenwashing: Misleading Consumers for Profit</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>As the global push for sustainability gains momentum, consumers increasingly favor products and services that claim to be environmentally friendly. Companies are quick to respond, branding their offerings as “green,” “sustainable” or “eco-conscious.” However, beneath the glossy labels and vibrant packaging, a darker trend is emerging: greenwashing. This deceptive practice not only misleads consumers but also undermines genuine efforts toward environmental sustainability for a profit.</p>
<h2>What is Greenwashing?</h2>
<p>Greenwashing occurs when a company falsely advertises or exaggerates the environmental benefits of its products, services or practices. Unlike simple marketing puffery, greenwashing involves deliberate deception designed to exploit consumers’ trust and willingness to support eco-friendly initiatives. Examples include overstating the recyclability of packaging, claiming to use renewable energy without proof or falsely labeling products as organic or non-toxic.</p>
<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/greenwashing#:~:text=Through%20deceptive%20marketing%20and%20false,and%20secure%20a%20sustainable%20planet."" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">United Nations</a>, “Through deceptive marketing and false claims of sustainability, greenwashing misleads consumers, investors, and the public, hampering the trust, ambition, and action needed to bring about global change and secure a sustainable planet.” </p>
<h2>A Growing Problem</h2>
<p>The rise of greenwashing coincides with an increased demand for sustainable products. A survey by <a href=""https://nielseniq.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/10/2022-10_ESG_eBook_NIQ_FNL.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">NielsenIQ</a> found that 78% of global consumers said a sustainable lifestyle is important to them. Unfortunately, some companies exploit this trend, placing financial gain above authentic environmental responsibility and ethical practices. </p>
<p>Greenwashing straddles the line between marketing malpractice and outright fraud. Under deceptive practices laws, false or exaggerated environmental claims can be subject to enforcement actions by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under <a href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/cch/200806/ftca.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Section 5 of the FTC Act</a>. While not classified as fraud in the legal sense, such deceptive practices can result in financial harm to consumers, who may pay premium prices for products or services they believe are sustainable, effectively defrauding them. For instance, a product advertised as “organic” or “100% recyclable” may cost more, yet its environmental benefits may be overstated or even nonexistent. This deception undermines consumer trust and diverts funds away from genuinely sustainable innovations. </p>
<p>The financial repercussions of greenwashing extend beyond consumer harm. While companies engaging in these deceptive practices may enjoy short-term profits, the long-term costs can be devastating. Regulatory fines, lawsuits and reputational damage often follow exposure of the deception, as seen in high-profile cases. Additionally, such actions erode public confidence in corporate sustainability initiatives, creating a ripple effect that could jeopardize legitimate efforts to address environmental challenges.  </p>
<p>Greenwashing is not merely a marketing ploy—it is a form of corruption that exploits consumer trust and undermines the integrity of sustainability efforts. By deliberately falsifying or exaggerating environmental claims, companies engage in deceptive practices that mirror other corrupt behaviors, such as fraud and bribery. These actions often involve circumventing regulations, manipulating data or even coercing third parties, such as certification bodies, to rubber-stamp unverified claims. This not only distorts markets but also erodes trust in environmental standards and institutions designed to promote accountability.</p>
<p>The corrupt nature of greenwashing becomes even more evident when companies use it to obscure unethical practices elsewhere in their operations. For example, while promoting the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/money/2001/apr/19/personalfinancenews.business1"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">“Beyond Petroleum”</a> campaign to position itself as a sustainability leader, British Petroleum (BP) continued to prioritize profits from fossil fuel extraction, often at the expense of worker safety and environmental integrity. BP spent heavily on green marketing to mask its expansion into oil and gas exploration in fragile ecosystems like the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Simultaneously, BP’s negligence in safety protocols led to catastrophic events, including the <a href=""https://www.icheme.org/media/14611/lpb275_pg04.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">2005 Texas refinery explosion</a> and the <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/deepwater-horizon-bp-gulf-mexico-oil-spill"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster</a>. These incidents, coupled with <a href=""https://www.greenpeace.org/static/planet4-usa-stateless/2024/11/164273e9-bp-bad-behavior.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">record-setting fines for safety violations</a>, highlight how BP’s greenwashing efforts not only attempted to mislead the public but also distract from its systemic exploitation of natural resources and disregard for human and environmental well-being.</p>
<p>BP’s past actions highlight how greenwashing can serve as a strategic tool for corruption, prioritizing profit and perception more than genuine environmental responsibility. </p>
<h2>Red Flags of Greenwashing</h2>
<p>To protect themselves, consumers and watchdog organizations should remain vigilant for signs of greenwashing. Red flags can include vague claims like “all-natural,” lack of certification or third-party verification, or the use of ambiguous terms like “sustainably sourced” without details. Additionally, greenwashing often involves selective disclosure, where companies highlight one eco-friendly aspect of their product while ignoring other harmful practices. For example, a company might advertise biodegradable packaging while maintaining a supply chain that relies on environmentally destructive practices. In 2009, the Coca-Cola Company introduced the <a href=""https://www.coca-colacompany.com/about-us/faq/what-is-plantbottle-packaging#:~:text=We%20introduced%20PlantBottle%E2%84%A2%2C%20the,sugar%20canes%20and%20other%20plants."" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">“world’s first fully recyclable PET plastic bottle”</a> made partially from plants. Despite the “PlantBottle” reducing reliance on fossil fuels for its production, Coca-Cola was still named the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/04/business/coca-cola-sustainability-goals-change/index.html#:~:text=Coca%2DCola%20was%20named%20as,organization%20Break%20Free%20from%20Plastic."" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">world’s top plastic polluter for the sixth consecutive year in 2023</a>. </p>
<h2>Combating Greenwashing </h2>
<p>To tackle greenwashing, regulatory bodies and advocacy groups are stepping up enforcement. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued updated <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/truth-advertising/green-guides"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Green Guides</a>, which outline the dos and don’ts of environmental marketing. Globally, governments are enacting stricter disclosure laws, requiring companies to substantiate their sustainability claims.</p>
<p>For businesses, the message is clear: transparency and accountability are non-negotiable. Companies that genuinely commit to sustainability must back up their claims with measurable, verifiable actions, instead of slapping a sticker on their company that says “green” to gain a profit or cover up questionable practices. </p>
<p>Greenwashing is a reminder that eco-friendly claims by companies are just that — claims. For consumers, this underscores the importance of scrutinizing labels and seeking independent verification before making purchases. For companies, it highlights the risks of prioritizing perception over substance. Addressing greenwashing is not just about protecting consumers. It is about ensuring that genuine efforts toward sustainability are recognized and rewarded.</p>

41,<h1>Top 5 Fraud Trends of 2025</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Mason Wilder,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                There are consistent factors in fraud, like social engineering tactics that exploit human behavioral tendencies or external financial pressures that lead fraudsters to commit their crimes, but there are also trends and themes that emerge and affect the anti-fraud profession on a more limited timeframe. <br/>
<br/>
Before getting into 2025 trends, it is worth revisiting the predictions for <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=top-5-fraud-trends-of-2024"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">2024 fraud trends</a>: <br/>
<h3>Scams Enhanced by Generative AI  </h3>
This trend came to fruition, with marked increases in the use of generative AI in schemes like phishing, business email compromise, account takeovers, impersonations, romance scams such as pig butchering, and more.  
<h3>A Resurgence of Cryptocurrency and Digital Asset Fraud </h3>
It is difficult to pinpoint exact figures for financial crime involving cryptocurrencies for 2024, especially this early in 2025, but even if figures from the <a href=""https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2023_IC3CryptocurrencyReport.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">FBI </a>or <a href=""https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-2024-crypto-crime-report-release.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Chainalysis’s </a>crypto crime reports for 2023 hold, the losses will likely be higher for 2024 due to the record high prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Anecdotal evidence suggests that crypto and other digital asset frauds did not lose any steam in 2024. <br/>
<h3>Fraud Involving AI Service Providers </h3>
There were at least a few cases of AI companies, and/or their leaders, misrepresenting their services. A few examples include an educational AI company’s founder <a href=""https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/founder-ai-company-schools-nyc-la-arrested-fraud/5999604/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">being arrested for fraud</a>, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href=""https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/founder-ai-company-schools-nyc-la-arrested-fraud/5999604/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">charging the CEO of an AI recruiting company with fraud</a>, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an operation targeting AI company’s misleading claims, <a href=""https://qz.com/ftc-ai-donotpay-scam-1851657725"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">which has already led to at least five lawsuits</a>. <br/>
<h3>Increased Obligations and/or Liabilities for Preventing and Detecting Fraud </h3>
The UK’s Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act has not gone into effect yet, but will in September 2025, and the U.K. issued <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/offence-of-failure-to-prevent-fraud-introduced-by-eccta/economic-crime-and-corporate-transparency-act-2023-guidance-to-organisations-on-the-offence-of-failure-to-prevent-fraud-accessible-version"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">official guidance</a> related to the act in November 2024. Neither of the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) or Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) officially updated their standards related to fraud, but the wheels of regulation move slowly and are still headed in the direction of increasing obligations for preventing and detecting fraud. <br/>
<h3>Continued COVID Fraud Enforcement in the U.S. </h3>
<p>
According to a<a href=""https://www.justice.gov/coronavirus/media/1347161/dl?inline"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> report from the U.S. Department of Justice’s COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force</a> (CFETF) released in April 2024, U.S. Attorney’s Offices and the DOJ’s Civil Division have opened more than 1,200 civil pandemic fraud matters and obtained more than 400 judgments or settlements netting more than $100 million in penalties, while also developing and rolling out database tools to detect and investigate fraud. The report also states that, “The CFETF and its member agencies have ongoing investigations into hundreds of identity thieves, transnational fraud and money laundering networks, large-dollar individual fraudsters and the businesses that facilitated these crimes. Government employees who chose to fraudulently obtain pandemic benefits are also being investigated. Civil enforcement tools are being utilized to recover misappropriated funds from businesses and individuals throughout the country. CFETF member agencies have improved their data analytics capabilities and are using these new skills to investigate fraud more efficiently and effectively. And the lessons learned by law enforcement from investigating pandemic fraud are being used to improve our investigatory efforts and passed on to the agencies tasked with administering benefit programs.”  <br/>
<br/>
These trends from 2024 are expected to continue in 2025, but there is no fun in repeating the same trends, so here are the additional developments that will likely take shape.  </p>
<hr/>
<h2>Fraud Trends to Watch For in 2025 </h2>
<h3>Decrease in Pig Butchering Schemes </h3>
Many people became aware of and familiar with the “Pig Butchering” scheme (a new spin on romance fraud in which victims are convinced to invest in sham cryptocurrency or digital asset platforms) in 2024. This awareness is approaching a critical mass that will likely force the criminal organizations behind these schemes to pivot their tactics.  <br/>
<br/>
One way to analyze this is through the lens of the Nigerian Prince scheme introduced in the late 1990s as people began regularly using email; after a certain point, enough people became familiar with the scam that it became a punchline. It took a while for that to happen, and many people were victimized along the way, but the nature of the internet’s evolution combined with laudable efforts of law enforcement organizations’ and victim advocacy groups’ awareness campaigns will likely shorten the pig butchering scam’s shelf-life. There will still be pig butchering scam victims in 2025, but I believe this year will show that we will move past the peak of this scam’s efficacy.  <br/>
<br/>
However, just because pig butchering scams might not be as effective or common by the end of 2025, anti-fraud professionals might not want to celebrate just yet… <br/>
<h3>Cyber-Scam Losses Continue to Mount </h3>
The types of criminal organizations that have invested operational resources into conducting the aforementioned pig butchering scams are not going to simply stop relying on scams and fraud for illicit income. As covered in a <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-magazine/all-issues/issue/article?s=2024-novdec-cracking-the-center"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">recent article by <em>Fraud Magazine</em></a> Editor-in-Chief Jen Liebman, hundreds of thousands of human trafficking victims are in “forced criminality” situations in Southeast Asia, and similar cyber-scamming criminal organizations have been identified worldwide. The high revenues (Interpol estimates $3 trillion of profits per year globally) from cyberfraud and lower-risk nature of those criminal operations compared to drug-trafficking, extortion and other organized crime, guarantees that these types of scam operations are not going away anytime soon—even if one of the currently preferred modalities becomes less effective. These scammers are sure to develop fresh tactics to scam both individuals and organizations in 2025, facilitated by corruption in the areas where these scam centers operate. <br/>
<br/>
For further insights about what it is like on the inside of these scam centers, an ACFE webinar held in March 2025 will feature a firsthand account from a human trafficking survivor who managed to escape one of these scam centers. <br/>
<h3>Synthetic Identity Fraud Increases </h3>
<p>
The use of synthetic identities in a wide variety of fraud schemes is nothing new, but in 2025, the types of AI tools that bolstered scams in 2024 through deepfakes, image, document and text generation and automation, will be applied to the creation and use of synthetic identities in fraud schemes targeting government and private organizations at a higher rate. This will likely stem, at least in part, from a combination of the previous two trends; as scams targeting individuals and enhanced by AI become less effective, the criminal organizations orchestrating them will put those resources to use creating and deploying synthetic individual and business identities to carry out new account frauds, loan frauds, government benefit frauds, invoice frauds and more. </p>
<p>It has never been easier for fraudsters to create convincing fraudulent persons or organizations and do so at a rate that will likely overwhelm the preventive and detective controls that organizations have in place. Anti-fraud professionals involved in the prevention and detection of synthetic identity fraud schemes will need to stay on their toes all of 2025 and be ready to update controls and fraud risk management frameworks regularly to adapt to the increasing and evolving threat. </p>
<h3>Financial Institutions, Money Service Businesses and Telecommunications Companies Can Expect Increased Blame </h3>
The practically unfathomable volumes of fraud revenues described thus far in this and last years’ trends blogs are understandably being accompanied by a general inclination to find new places to point fingers in blame. With resource limitations for investigation and prosecution plus a lack of will (or complicity), there is only so much that authorities can do on their own to stop fraud risks.  <br/>
<br/>
Since fraud revenues generally have to pass through financial institutions and/or money service businesses at some point, while fraudsters also have to utilize telecommunications networks for the emails, chats, calls and messages that target victims, these types of businesses will likely face increased pressure from governments, regulators and victims to help stem the flow of fraud through their operations.  <br/>
<br/>
Examples of what this could look like include <a href=""https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/at-a-glance-duties-of-telcos-and-banks-under-singapores-scam-liability-framework"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Singapore’s brand-new scam liability framework</a> for telecommunication companies and banks, civil suits from scam victims against financial institutions for not doing enough to prevent fraud, such as a <a href=""https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/56358211/Liem_v_Chong_Hing_Bank_Limited_et_al"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">recent suit</a> filed by a pig butchering victim. Additionally, regulators could impose additional requirements related to fraud detection and prevention on financial institutions alongside well-established anti-money laundering (AML), combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. <br/>
<h3>Anti-Fraud Professional Job Landscape Shifts </h3>
What it looks like to be an anti-fraud professional and where those anti-fraud professionals work could look a lot different by the end of 2025. Regime/administration changes in many countries worldwide, including the U.S., is likely to result in many anti-fraud professionals leaving government positions (voluntarily or otherwise) and entering the private sector, which will have them facing different sets of risks and tasks.  <br/>
<br/>
Simultaneously, the increasing fraud risks facing the private and public sectors are being met with an increased appetite/demand for technological solutions (especially those based on or incorporating AI) that will complement human efforts, which will require many anti-fraud professionals to learn how to best utilize and work alongside these tools. <br/>
<br/>
Anti-fraud professionals should place additional emphasis in 2025 on learning about emerging anti-fraud technologies and how they work to stand out in what will likely be a competitive job market.

42,<h1>Stuffing the Stockings: Unwrapping Stock Market Manipulation and Insider Trading Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                As the holiday season unfolds, the spirit of giving takes center stage. Yet in the financial world, there are always those whose ""gifts"" undermine markets and erode trust. Stock market manipulation and insider trading fraud are perennial challenges, with fraudsters capitalizing on information asymmetry and exploiting investor psychology. This December, let’s pull back the curtain on these schemes and examine the regulatory and ethical implications that impact global markets. <br/>
<h2>Insider Trading: The Market’s Unraveled Stocking </h2>
Insider trading is a breach of trust and an affront to the principles of market fairness. It occurs when individuals use non-public, material information to execute trades for personal or organizational gain. Unlike public investors who rely on disclosed information to guide decisions, insiders possess an unfair informational advantage that undermines the integrity of financial markets. <br/>
<br/>
A pivotal example is the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-38"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">2020 Securities and Exchange Commission</a> charges against executives of Eastman Kodak, who allegedly traded shares ahead of a major government loan announcement. The actions, which came under intense scrutiny, highlight how insider trading erodes investor confidence and prompts regulatory crackdowns that ripple across industries. <br/>
<br/>
Insider trading’s implications stretch beyond regulatory fines and prison sentences. It distorts market efficiency, discourages retail investors and creates volatility that threatens economic stability. Addressing this issue requires not just enforcement but a culture of compliance and proactive disclosure mechanisms within organizations. <br/>
<h2>Stock Market Manipulation: Weaving Complex Schemes </h2>
Stock market manipulation operates in a realm where perception drives value—a space fraudsters exploit through misinformation and artificial market movements. Unlike insider trading, which relies on privileged information, manipulation focuses on engineering outcomes that benefit a few at the expense of many. <br/>
<br/>
For example, pump-and-dump schemes remain a common tactic. Fraudsters inflate the value of low-volume or penny stocks by spreading misleading information, often leveraging online forums or social media platforms. Once prices surge due to artificially created demand, the orchestrators sell off their holdings, leaving unsuspecting investors with plummeting stock values. <br/>
<br/>
A modern variation of these schemes has emerged in cryptocurrency markets, where digital assets are particularly susceptible to price manipulation due to limited regulation and transparency. This evolution highlights the need for regulatory frameworks to adapt swiftly to emerging asset classes. <br/>
<h2>Regulatory Tools and Challenges </h2>
The SEC and similar regulatory bodies worldwide have stepped up enforcement in recent years, armed with enhanced technologies and whistleblower programs. <a href=""https://www.velaw.com/insights/utilizing-data-analytics-sec-harnesses-the-power-to-unveil-insider-trading-patterns-and-prioritizes-egregious-cases"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The SEC’s use of big data analytics</a> to identify suspicious trading patterns has been a game changer, enabling regulators to spot trends that may otherwise go unnoticed in high-volume markets. <br/>
<br/>
Challenges persist, however. The decentralized nature of global markets, the rise of anonymous trading platforms and the increasing complexity of financial products create fertile ground for fraud. Regulators must not only act reactively but also build preventative systems that combine transparency, education and stringent oversight. <br/>

<h2>Strategic Safeguards </h2>
<p>Investors, firms and regulators must align efforts to combat these sophisticated fraud schemes. Key strategies include: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Leveraging Technology for Detection: </strong><a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4240205"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Artificial intelligence and machine learning tools</a> can monitor trading activity in real time, flagging anomalies that suggest manipulation or insider trading. </li>
<li><strong>Building Corporate Compliance Cultures:</strong> Organizations should enforce rigorous insider trading policies and provide robust training to employees, particularly those with access to sensitive information. </li>
<li><strong>Enhancing Global Cooperation:</strong> Fraud is often transnational, requiring governments and regulators to collaborate across jurisdictions to ensure enforcement actions are comprehensive and effective. </li>
<li><strong>Strengthening Whistleblower Protections:</strong> Encouraging employees to report unethical behavior without fear of retaliation is critical. Whistleblower programs, <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/whistleblower-program"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">like those run by the SEC</a>, are invaluable in uncovering fraud schemes early. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Stocking Up on Integrity </h2>
In the spirit of the season, markets must embrace fairness as a shared gift, not an individual privilege. The battle against insider trading and market manipulation is ongoing, requiring vigilance, expertise and innovation from all market participants. <br/>
<br/>
As we hang our holiday stockings, let’s not forget to hang our hopes on robust enforcement, ethical leadership and the power of informed, engaged investors. Together, we can ensure fraudsters are left out in the cold.

43,<h1>Fraudify Wrapped 2024: The Year in Fraud Trends</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Welcome to Fraudify Wrapped 2024! This year, fraud examiners tracked the top scams reshaping industries, the most impacted sectors and the tools fraudsters wielded with alarming innovation. Drawing from industry trends, news stories and expert insights, we have compiled a recap of the biggest fraud developments of the year.</p>
<p><img alt=""Fraudify Wrapped Social Media"" src=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/images/acfe/blog/socialmedia_fraudifywrapped_2024_1200x630.png?h=315&amp;w=600&amp;hash=E4D5B58BE9C349EE6FB01F0456A31549"" style=""width:600px; height:315px;""/></p>
<h2>The Top Frauds of 2024</h2>
<p>
These schemes dominated the fraud landscape, posing challenges for individuals and organizations alike:</p>
<h3>1. Pig Butchering</h3>
Fraudsters lured victims into fake investment schemes by posing as romantic interests or long-lost friends. Once trust was established, they manipulated victims into transferring large sums to fraudulent cryptocurrency and digital asset investment platforms. The twist? Many scammers used artificial intelligence (AI) to maintain convincing interactions. <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/pig-butchering-scams-go-high-tech/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Pig butchering scams</a> reached a new level of sophistication, with fraudsters deploying professional-looking websites, social media profiles and even customer service representatives to make their operations appear legitimate. <a href=""https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/cracking-down-organized-crime-scam-centers/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Meta released a statement</a> on going after criminal organizations behind pig butchering schemes, stating, “This year alone, we’ve taken down over two million accounts linked to scam centers in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines.” These scams were not only devastating financially but emotionally, as victims invested their savings and time into building relationships with scammers who had no intention of ever returning their funds. Global losses from these schemes skyrocketed, with a surge in targeted regions such as Southeast Asia and North America.
<h3>2. Account Takeovers and New Account Fraud</h3>
This trend saw cybercriminals exploiting stolen credentials to hijack accounts or create fraudulent ones. <a href=""https://www.security.org/digital-safety/account-takeover-annual-report/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Account takeovers</a> have reached alarming rates over the past few years, with a notable uptick in attacks on online banking platforms and e-commerce websites. Fraudsters often used information obtained from data breaches or social engineering tactics to gain access to financial accounts and make unauthorized withdrawals. On the other hand, new account fraud flourished, as criminals used synthetic identities to open new accounts and secure loans, often escaping detection due to advancements in AI technology. These schemes were most prevalent in the financial services industry, where fraudsters circumvented financial institutions' automated fraud detection systems to carry out large-scale money laundering operations.
<h3>3. Synthetic Identity Fraud</h3>
By merging real and fabricated data, criminals created <a href=""https://statescoop.com/synthetic-identity-fraud-data-breaches-transunion-report-2024/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">synthetic identities</a> that slipped through detection systems. This type of fraud has become even more sophisticated, with fraudsters combining legitimate personal information with fabricated elements to create entirely new identities. These synthetic identities were then used to secure credit lines, loans and even government benefits. Financial institutions and other service providers found it increasingly difficult to spot these fraudsters, as the synthetic profiles often appeared to have established histories, complete with credit reports and verifiable employment records. Synthetic identity fraud continued to plague the <a href=""https://ekata.com/resource/synthetic-identity-fraud-and-trust-mastercard-identity-connect-london/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">financial services</a> and retail sectors, with fraudsters leveraging these fake identities for criminal activities such as money laundering, credit card fraud and loan defaults.
<h3>4. Deepfake Business Email Compromise (BEC)</h3>
BEC scams continued evolving in sophistication through the increased incorporation of deepfake technology. Fraudsters created hyper-realistic AI-generated video and audio to impersonate executives, convincing employees to authorize large payments. Deepfake BEC became one of the most sophisticated scams, with cybercriminals using AI to simulate the voices and faces of company CEOs, CFOs and even government officials. These deepfakes were used to deceive employees into transferring funds, altering contracts or divulging sensitive information. In some cases, the fraudsters even used deepfake technology to <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">impersonate high-level employees</a> in virtual meetings. The success of these scams relied on how convincing the deepfakes were and the industry saw a rise in software developed specifically to detect these fraudulent media manipulations.
<h3>5. Government Impersonation</h3>
Scammers posed as government officials, targeting individuals and businesses with fake IRS calls, counterfeit permits and fraudulent grant offers. The frequency of these scams is increasing, with fraudsters impersonating government agencies to defraud citizens out of tax payments, welfare checks or social security benefits. Some scammers even went so far as to create fake websites that mirrored official government portals, convincing victims to input personal information or make payments to fake accounts. <a href=""https://www.commercebank.com/personal/ideas-and-tips/2024/beware-of-scammers-impersonating-government-officials-what-you-need-to-know"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Government impersonation</a> also affected businesses, with fraudsters submitting fraudulent applications for government contracts and grants. These schemes disrupted operations, drained financial resources and damaged reputations.
<h2>Top Industries Affected by Fraud</h2>
<p>
Fraud spared no sector, but these industries faced the brunt of attacks:</p>
<h3>1. Healthcare</h3>
Fraudulent claims, fake suppliers and billing scams surged, exploiting weaknesses in a stressed sector. Healthcare institutions, particularly hospitals, have been hit hard with <a href=""https://www.hchlawyers.com/blog/2024/august/healthcare-billing-fraud-10-recent-cases/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">fraudulent billing schemes</a>. Fraudsters submitted fake invoices or overstated charges for medical procedures and equipment. In some cases, they even posed as medical suppliers to sell <a href=""https://www.jnj.com/innovation/how-johnson-and-johnson-is-fighting-medical-counterfeiting"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">counterfeit or substandard medications</a>. This type of fraud not only resulted in financial losses but also put patients' health and safety at risk. Additionally, healthcare providers continued to be prime targets for cybercriminals, who used stolen personal health information to launch identity theft and insurance fraud schemes.
<h3>2. Government</h3>
Impersonation scams and fraudulent applications for grants and benefits highlighted vulnerabilities in public systems. The government sector saw a significant rise in fraud schemes in recent years, particularly targeting <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/covid-19-fraud-enforcement-task-force-releases-2024-report"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">COVID-19 relief funds</a>, unemployment benefits and other social services. Scammers exploited government programs designed to provide financial relief during the pandemic by submitting false claims and using stolen identities. These scams not only hurt the financial integrity of governments but also eroded public trust in their ability to protect citizens. Additionally, since governments have an enormous amount of obligations for which they depend on private sector companies, contract and procurement fraud continues to be a major concern for government agencies.
<h3>3. Financial Services </h3>
Account takeovers and synthetic identity fraud led to significant monetary losses and damaged trust. The financial services sector has remained a top target for fraudsters, with <a href=""https://www.security.org/digital-safety/account-takeover-annual-report/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">account takeovers</a> affecting banks, investment firms and e-commerce platforms. Fraudsters also used synthetic identities to gain access to loans, credit lines and even open new accounts, leaving financial institutions with massive losses. Financial services companies struggled to keep up with the sophisticated tactics used by criminals, who often leveraged stolen data from previous breaches or used AI tools to manipulate fraud detection systems. The rising cost of fraud in the financial sector has led many institutions to invest heavily in new technologies, such as AI-powered fraud prevention systems, to detect and mitigate these risks.
<h3>4. Manufacturing</h3>
Supply chain scams, including <a href=""https://www.marshmma.com/us/insights/details/fraudulent-vendor-claims.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">fake vendor schemes</a>, created logistical nightmares. The manufacturing industry found itself increasingly targeted by fraudsters who posed as suppliers or vendors to intercept payments or deliver counterfeit goods. Scammers often exploited the industry's reliance on complex supply chains and global networks, tricking companies into paying for goods that were never delivered or for substandard materials. As manufacturers grappled with disrupted supply chains, the financial impact of these frauds grew, with some companies losing millions of dollars in fake orders and payments.
<h3>5. Construction </h3>
Fraudsters exploited payment systems and posed as contractors to swindle businesses. The construction industry has faced a surge in fraud schemes, with <a href=""https://www.enr.com/articles/59451-justice-served-scammer-sentenced-in-major-construction-payment-fraud"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">criminals posing as contractors</a>, subcontractors or suppliers to receive payments for non-existent work or materials. These scams were often facilitated by forged documents and fake invoices that appeared legitimate at first glance. The construction industry’s vulnerability to fraud grew as digital payment systems became more prevalent, making it easier for fraudsters to manipulate payment approvals or alter financial records. Additionally, the high costs associated with many construction projects tend to lead to large losses when fraud does occur. 
<h2>Fraud Genre of the Year: AI-Powered Fraud</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence was the headline act in 2024’s fraud trends, as evident throughout this blog. Fraudsters deployed AI to craft realistic phishing emails, automate social engineering and create networks of fake identities. Deepfakes, synthetic data and automated scam operations blurred the line between human and machine-led fraud. AI-powered fraud tools grew exponentially this year, making it harder for traditional fraud detection methods to keep pace. </p>
<p>In a recent <a href=""https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA241203"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Public Service Announcement (PSA)</a> released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the FBI warned the public that “criminals exploit generative artificial intelligence (AI) to commit fraud on a larger scale which increases the believability of their schemes.” Additionally, they pointed out that “Generative AI reduces the time and effort criminals must expend to deceive their targets,” making it easier and faster for criminals to generate convincing fake identities or manipulate large datasets in a fraction of the time it took human fraudsters.</p>
<h2>""Fraudify"" Highlights</h2>
<p>
Here are fraud highlights that stood out to us throughout 2024:</p>
<h3>Tactic of the Year: </h3>

45,<h1>Fraudsters Unveiled: What Decades of Data Tell Us About Perpetrators</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Emily Homer,  Ph.D., CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>When the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) conducted its first <em><a href=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/files/acfe/pdfs/1996-rttn.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Report to the Nation</a></em> in 1996, one of the purposes was to describe the typical occupational fraud perpetrator. In 1996, our results showed that the typical fraudster was a college-educated married white male employee. Men committed nearly 75% of the offenses. <br/>
<br/>
In the <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/files/acfe/pdfs/2002rttn.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">2002 edition of the study</a>, not much had changed. The typical perpetrator was still a male employee aged 41–50 (note that this edition did not ask for the fraudsters’ marital status or race). However, this edition showed that the majority of perpetrators had a high school education or less, which varied from the previous study. Additionally, the gap between male and female perpetrators was much narrower, with only 53.5% of cases being primarily perpetrated by men. This report also introduced the question of criminal history, which revealed that most perpetrators had no known criminal history of ever being charged or convicted of a fraud-related offense. <br/>
<br/>
In 2008, the <em><a href=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/files/acfe/pdfs/rttn/2008/2008-rttn.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Report to the Nation</a></em> included a new section describing the red flags that perpetrators exhibited. This continues to be one of the most consistent portions of the report from year to year. In 2008, the top eight documented red flags included: </p>
<ul>
<li>Living beyond means</li>
<li>Financial difficulties</li>
<li>Wheeler-dealer attitude  </li>
<li>Control issues, unwillingness to share duties</li>
<li>Divorce/family problems</li>
<li>Unusually close association with vendor or customer</li>
<li>Irritability, suspiciousness or defensiveness</li>
<li>Addiction problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the introduction of red flags into the report, these eight remain the most common red flags — although the order of frequency has alternated over the years. Living beyond means and financial difficulties have been the top two most common red flags in each report. </p>
<p>Like previous editions, the most recent report asked for demographics of the primary perpetrator in each case. <em><a href=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/files/acfe/pdfs/rttn/2024/2024-report-to-the-nations.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Occupational Fraud 2024: A Report to the Nations</a></em> showed that perpetrators were statistically most likely to be: </p>
<ul>
<li>A manager (41% of cases) </li>
<li>An employee for 1–5 years (45% of cases) </li>
<li>Employed in the operations department (14% of cases) </li>
<li>Male (74% of cases) </li>
<li>College-educated (67% of cases) </li>
<li>Aged 36–40 (19% of cases) </li>
<li>Living beyond their means (39% of cases) </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, most perpetrators had no documented history of charges or convictions of fraud-related offenses (87% of cases) or employment-related disciplinary actions for fraud (85% of cases). <br/>
<br/>
While the profile of the typical offender has remained mostly consistent, it should be noted that not all offenders fit into this demographic. The typical perpetrator varies depending upon many factors, including the organization’s industry, location, age, etc. The results of our analyses are derived from the cases that our survey participants reported.  <br/>
<br/>
Our research paints a clear and sobering picture: fraud knows no boundaries. Perpetrators can emerge from any demographic, role or industry, defying assumptions and stereotypes. No organization is untouchable, and no individual is beyond scrutiny. For fraud examiners, this serves as a critical reminder: vigilance and unbiased investigation are the keys to uncovering the truth no matter where it may hide. </p>

<p>As all Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs) are aware, fraud is any activity that relies on deception in order to achieve a gain. Fraudulent activity can happen in nearly every sector of every industry, even in the most unexpected or far-reaching places. Indeed, food fraud is not unheard of with discoveries of <a href=""https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2024/08/08/olive-oil-fraud-increases-in-europe"">fake olive oil</a>, <a href=""https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/from-honey-laundering-to-fake-free-range-food-fraud-costs-billions"">honey-laundering</a>, <a href=""https://vinepair.com/booze-news/ocean-fathoms-illegal-wine-destroyed/"">sea-cellar wine</a> and <a href=""https://www.wine-searcher.com/m/2023/08/fraud-claims-in-champagne?srsltid=AfmBOoqCGUqRhuNKEBFBszLt6nl_rkX_aibZr8Bh5nK6oaB2vlKzjpXR"">shammy bubbles</a>. </p>
<p><a href=""https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/food-fraud-quality/topic/food-fraud_en"">Food fraud</a> is considered “any deliberate action of businesses or individuals to deceive others in regard to the integrity of food to gain undue advantage."" This includes <a href=""https://fsns.com/what-is-food-fraud/"">food adulteration</a>, which is the intentional addition or modification of a food product with inferior, cheaper or non-authentic substances, often to increase volume or weight or to improve appearance, which can compromise the product’s quality, safety and nutritional value. <br/>
<br/>
Food fraud is dangerous for many reasons. It has the potential to cause harm to people and the economy through its deception. When ingredients are removed or added, it greatly changes the product that is being sold, which may harm individuals, as well as damage the reputations of companies and industries at large. <a href=""https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/food-fraud-quality/topic/food-fraud_en"">According to scientists</a>, the most common food fraud involves olive oil, milk, honey, saffron, orange juice, apple juice, grape wine, vanilla extract and fish. </p>

<h2>How Does Food Fraud Occur? </h2>
<p>But food fraud can be further examined as it is not as simple as a food product that is not what it claims to be. The types of fraud can be categorized, according to an article recently published by the <a href=""https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-is-food-fraud-and-how-can-nuclear-science-detect-it"">International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</a>.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Dilution occurs when a high value liquid ingredient is mixed with a lower value liquid to reduce the concentration and lower the costs of production.</li>
<li>Substitution is when a high value ingredient or part of a product is replaced with another ingredient/part of lower value. </li>
<li>Mislabeling is the false information that is placed on the packaging or the label. </li>
<li>Unapproved enhancement happens when unknown/undeclared materials are added to a food product. </li>
<li>Concealment occurs when poor quality food ingredients or products are intentionally hidden.</li>
<li>Counterfeiting is when a brand name, design, recipe or unique techniques are copied. </li>
<li>Grey market production/theft/diversion happens when unregistered products are sold.</li>

<p>Scientists have used stable isotopes to detect the origin of food because the ratios are like nature’s ""fingerprints"" or signatures on food, which means the geographical or botanical provenance of food can be traced using these isotopic fingerprints. That is, this information can provide insight on whether the foods consist of the authentic ingredients advertised on the label or not.   Why Does Food Fraud Occur? </p>
The <a href=""https://www.ifst.org/resources/information-statements/food-fraud"">Institute of Food Science and Technology (IFST)</a> finds there are several factors contribute to food fraud such as: 
<h4>Opportunity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Inherent technical aspects of the products, such as the physical state of an ingredient or product (e.g. liquid versus powder); degree of processing (e.g. a herb as a whole plant is less vulnerable than dried leaves); whether there is an analytical testing method and the availability of the detection method; knowledge (e.g. diluting milk with water and replacing with melamine to increase the apparent protein content); complexity of composition (e.g. vanilla); non-food grade equivalent available; availability of technology. </li>
<li>Technical measures such as product testing upon receipt, supplier approval programs and functional performance of ingredients. </li>
<li>Access by authorized employees, visitors, contractors or unauthorized people to products during the supply chain, for example during manufacture or storage. </li>
<li>Number of times the product changes hand/or use of agents and brokers. </li>
<li>Transparency of the supply chain. </li>
<li>Differences in availability and demand. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Economic Factors</h4>
<p>These can include customer pressure to reduce prices, availability versus demand, supply shortage due to political unrest, increase in prices, austerity measures impacting regulatory agencies and trade barriers etc. </p>
<h4>Lack of Control Measures </h4>
<ul>
<li>Technical - Food safety legislation, historical lack of testing for the adulterant (e.g. starch in food), inability to test (e.g. no analytical test) etc. </li>
<li>Managerial - Lack of regulatory enforcement, food security, stable government, social/business acceptance (‘fraud does not harm anyone’ attitude or ‘it will not happen to us’), specifications/contracts etc. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Complexity of Supply Chain</h4>
<p>Supply chain issues may include length, transparency, vertical integration, single ingredient source from approved supplier as opposed to open market etc. </p>
<h4>Insufficient Supplier Approval and Performance Programs</h4>
<p>Examples of this are on-site audits that include a food fraud component, analytical testing and tracking of analytical results and complaints. </p>
<h4>History of Food Fraud</h4>
<p>This may be recurring fraud in the same product over a period of time, a pattern of food fraud in growing/manufacturing country and number of legitimate reported incidents can point to increased food fraud vulnerabilities. </p>
<h2>What Can Be Done? </h2>
<p>Just like an organization can consider their fraud risk with a fraud risk assessment, <a href=""https://fsns.com/how-to-conduct-a-food-fraud-vulnerability-assessment-free-checklist/"">food fraud vulnerability assessments</a> are used to identify potential vulnerabilities in a supply chain that might make a business susceptible to food fraud by systematically evaluating each of the ingredients in isolation, its supply chain and the control measures in place to determine where the gaps may exist. Like any fraud examination, questions relevant to the situation must be asked: </p>
<ul>
<li>Do my ingredients have a history of food fraud?  </li>
<li>Where are my ingredients sourced from?  </li>
<li>What degree of processing does my ingredients require?  </li>
<li>How complex is my supply chain?  </li>
<li>What controls do I have in place to ensure authenticity?  </li>
<li>How robust are my supplier verification processes? </li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href=""https://foodfraudadvisors.com/food-vulnerability-assessment-how/"">Vulnerability Assessment</a> can help users understand the likelihood of food fraud affecting a food product or ingredient, the impacts of food fraud on consumers and the food brand and provide a framework to prioritize strategies to prevent food fraud occurring and mitigate the risks if fraud does occur. </p>

47,<h1>How Internal Audit Powers Fraud Investigations and Protects Organizations from Within</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Fraud is a costly and complex threat to organizations, demanding strategic and well-executed defenses. Among the most valuable assets in an organization’s fraud prevention toolkit is its internal audit team. <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/career/career-paths/career-path-auditing/career-path-detail-internal-auditor"">Internal auditors</a> have the advantage of an insider’s view of an organization’s controls, making them uniquely positioned to help identify fraud risks and support investigations. <br/>
<h2>The Strategic Position of Internal Audit in Detecting Fraud </h2>
Internal auditors are embedded within the organization, with access to systems, controls and transactions. They do not just understand the organization’s policies; they understand the gaps and weak points where fraud can creep in. By examining irregular patterns, flagging unusual transactions and assessing where internal controls may falter, they serve as an early warning system. <br/>
<br/>
Rather than waiting for a whistleblower or a suspicious transaction to trigger an investigation, internal auditors can spot the signs of fraud as part of their regular risk assessments. This proactive approach is especially valuable in industries prone to complex schemes—such as those involving procurement, payroll or regulatory reporting. <br/>
<h2>Internal Audit’s Key Role in Investigations </h2>
<p>When fraud is suspected, internal auditors can support or even lead the initial fact-finding phase. Their investigative role varies by organization, but it typically includes: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Gathering and Analysis:</strong> Internal auditors have access to high volumes of operational data and understand its nuances, allowing them to dive into the numbers with a critical eye. This skillset is essential for identifying trends or anomalies that signal fraud, such as unexplained spikes in spending or suspicious vendor activity. </li>
<li><strong>Uncovering Internal Control Failures:</strong> A key strength of internal audit lies in its capacity to examine whether controls are functioning as intended. If a control weakness is uncovered, internal audit can explore how it might have enabled fraud—and recommend changes to strengthen defenses moving forward. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Navigating Challenges and Conflicts </h2>
Internal auditors face challenges that may constrain their involvement in fraud detection. There is often a fine line between their roles in audit and investigation, and they must maintain objectivity, especially if the suspected fraud involves senior leadership. Additionally, resource constraints or limited forensic training can present hurdles. Yet, these challenges underscore the importance of collaboration between internal audit, compliance, legal and dedicated fraud investigators. <br/>
<h2>Building a Resilient Anti-Fraud Culture </h2>
Beyond detecting and investigating fraud, internal audit teams are instrumental in cultivating a culture that discourages fraudulent behavior. After each investigation, they assess the findings to improve internal controls and advise on how to reduce fraud vulnerabilities in the future. This is where the internal audit function’s true value shines: by embedding fraud prevention into daily operations, they help create an organization more resilient to fraud risks. <br/>
<h2>The Path Forward for Internal Audit </h2>
<p>
While internal auditors are essential to fraud detection, they often face challenges like limited forensic training, resource constraints and the need to balance investigative and auditing roles. Investing in continuous education can help auditors stay ahead of emerging fraud risks and hone their skills in identifying red flags. </p>
<p>For those seeking to deepen their expertise, the ACFE’s <em><a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/all-products/product-detail-page?s=Auditing-CPE-Bundle"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Auditing CPE Bundle</a></em> offers in-depth courses focused on core principles of fraud prevention and detection, making it a valuable resource for expanding knowledge and maintaining a proactive approach to fraud risks. <br/>
<br/>
The role of internal audit is evolving as fraud schemes grow more sophisticated. Organizations that empower internal auditors to play an active part in fraud investigations not only improve their detection capabilities but also foster a culture of accountability and transparency. In this sense, internal audit does not just monitor compliance; it safeguards the organization’s integrity, one audit at a time. </p>

48,<h1>Is It Enough? Fraud Prevention and Risk Management Considerations</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Colin May,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                It's a story that fraud examiners know all too well: a small non-profit organization or government agency ruled by one or two people, with little oversight and even less controls. Funds, either donated or paid by tax dollars, are siphoned off with ease, often for years, until the house of cards fall. But the damage is extensive—not only in wasted time, effort and lost money, but also trust in the organization, the agency and the people involved. <br/>
<br/>
But what does it mean to have an organization that has a culture that ensures a massive theft does not occur—or if someone does attempt a fraud, it is caught early? <br/>
<br/>
Recently, this question was posed to me by a fellow Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE). I have written extensively on the issues of fraud, theft and embezzlement from these non-profits and small agencies. In fact, one story in Fraud Magazine detailed the years-long theft by the <a href=""https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294994743"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Fire Chief of a small town in New Hampshire</a> and another described a healthcare scheme perpetrated by leaders of a <a href=""https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294981994"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">non-profit ambulance squad in rural Virginia</a>. <br/>
<h2>The Culture Matters </h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/videos/video-detail?s=fraud-and-the-tone-at-the-top&amp;utm_source=acfeinsights&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=202411-Insights-Nov6"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Tone at the top</a> is critical in ensuring that an organization’s leaders model a positive and affirming culture that has zero tolerance for fraud and misconduct. But beyond the tone at the top, it must seep into the bones, so that everyone understands the expectations. Culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, norms and practices that shape the behavior and interactions of an organization and its staff, vendors, suppliers, contractors and other stakeholders.  <br/>
<br/>
Anti-fraud culture can be integrated in three ways: what I call the 3C’s of organizational culture.  </p>
<ul>
<li>First, there must be a <strong>culture of compliance</strong>—compliance often gets an unnecessary stigma, but it is essential to ensure that rules, laws and policies are followed. Otherwise, it becomes a “free-for-all” environment where norms and rules do not matter. We want people to understand why these exist and how they protect the organization, the employees, stakeholders, customers and the public. </li>
<li>Second, there must be a <strong>culture of competence</strong>—staff must know their roles, duties and responsibilities. Competence means that cross-training, mandatory vacations, routine and non-routine (or “surprise” reviews) are conducted. People appreciate that training, education, learning and development enable them to be good at their jobs and have the ability to move forward in their careers. </li>
<li>Finally, the third “C” is <strong>culture of commitment</strong>—this starts with the leaders but must encompass everyone involved. It is not only about the commitment to anti-fraud, but about the organization’s values, mission, processes and people. How committed are the staff? How accessible and committed are leaders at every level? How committed is the organization to robust fraud and enterprise risk management, prevention, detection and mitigation? </li>
</ul>
<h2>Growth Can Be a Problem </h2>
Rapid and extensive expansion of an organization can be both a blessing and a curse; it also poses significant challenges for fraud prevention and risk management. As new employees join quickly, it can be challenging to communicate the core values and commitments that define the organization.  <br/>
<br/>
While a large influx of new perspectives and talent can be important, it can also dilute the established culture, especially if it previously had strong anti-fraud policies. Communication can also be problematic, as more people causes the organization to be less personal, more bureaucratic and stiffer. Dynamics can shift, leadership can become overwhelmed and key priorities (such as fiscal management and stewardship) can become lost. <br/>
<br/>
Take, for example, a governmental entity that suddenly finds itself expanding beyond its initial geographic footprint. Although the name and some details have been changed, the facts are accurate and illustrative of the challenges leadership faces.  <br/>
<h2>Assessing The Issues </h2>
<p>The Hamish Firefighting Division encompasses a large, multi-county territory with more than 100,000 residents. Over the last five years, they have expanded their operation to merge or contract with additional municipalities and unincorporated townships. The budget expanded from $3.7 million in 2020 to a proposed budget of nearly $17 million in 2025.  <br/>
<br/>
Hamish is overseen by a board of trustees, has an outside legal counsel and is headed by a fire chief, along with multiple deputy chiefs and administrative staff. One of the trustees is appointed as the Financial Officer, like a treasurer of a non-profit organization. It is also subject to financial compliance examinations by the state auditor, which has conducted eight audits since 2018 (all of which are publicly available). The meetings of the board are public, conducted in person and accessible via online video conferencing. In addition, on its website, Hamish posts the detailed meeting minutes of the board of trustees, along with the financial information, statements and budgets. <br/>
<br/>
While these are all good things, it is essential to dive deeper into three areas: </p>
<ul>
<li>Does the Board of Trustees have the requisite financial and managerial knowledge to effectively oversee the division? </li>
<li>Does the division have a comprehensive <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/files/acfe/pdfs/fraud-risk-tools/coso-fraud-risk-management-guide-second-edition-executive-summary.pdf?utm_source=acfeinsights&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=202411-Insights-Nov6"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">fraud and enterprise risk management</a> plan in place that identifies, mitigates and controls for these occurrences? </li>
<li>Does the division have policies, procedures, monitoring, training, reporting mechanisms and awareness to ensure prompt attention to these issues? </li>
</ul>
<p>While many small organizations cannot afford to pay salaries for experienced fraud examiners and financial managers to ensure proper documentation, organization and oversight, the risk for fraud and exploitation always exists. Controls need to be in place, the tone at the top needs to be set and driven home throughout the organization and there must be competent staff and volunteers (including the oversight authority) who understand how and why fraud is committed and <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/fraud-risk-tools---coso/tools?utm_source=acfeinsights&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=202411-Insights-Nov6"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">what can be done to prevent and mitigate it</a>. Not having those will be very costly, possibly resulting in the demise of the organization. <br/>
<br/>
We will never fully prevent all fraud, but fraud prevention and risk management are crucial for smaller organizations. Leaders must ensure—and the taxpayers and stakeholders must demand—that there are adequate resources to incorporate risk management and anti-fraud policies and processes into their work.  <br/>
<br/>
By conducting regular <a href=""https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/be/pdf/2019/05/KPMG_Forensic_Fraud_Risk_Management_Talkbook.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">fraud risk assessments</a>, leaders and the board can identify the potential areas that are most vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse and misconduct. Through effective implementation of controls, policies and procedures, the organization will be better positioned to prevent and detect fraud.  Through the strategies and considerations outlined above, small organizations can significantly reduce the risk of fraud and ensure their operations remain transparent and accountable, ultimately serving the mission and people who need it the most. </p>

51,"<h1>Conflicts, Corruption and Bribery: A Summary of 2023 Cases</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Colin May,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                On July 31, 2024, the <a href=""https://oge.gov/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Office of Government Ethics</a> (OGE) published their annual survey on major federal conflicts of interest prosecutions from 2023. This <a href=""https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Resources/Conflict+of+Interest+Prosecution+Surveys%20(by%20Year)"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">yearly compilation</a>, which dates back to 1990, highlights key cases involving conflict of interest, bribery and corruption by federal employees, contractors, grant recipients and others. <br/>
<h2>How These Summaries Can Be Useful</h2>
Understanding the basics of these complex conflict of interest and corruption cases can be useful for fraud examiners, even those outside of government. Reviewing them enables Certified Fraud Examiners (CFEs) to assess the methodologies, the schemes, attributes of the participants and resolutions. In turn, these can help fraud examiners in conducting risk assessments, fraud prevention work and catalog red flags. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, these can be useful to write ethical or investigative training scenarios or deliver fraud awareness case studies. The OGE summary also contains links to key documents, which often contain further details, such as the indictment, plea agreement or statement of facts. <br/>
<h2>By the Numbers</h2>
The 2023 survey included eight cases, which to be sure, is not the entirety of corruption cases brought over the year—it merely represents those directly involving federal employees or contractors. There are numerous other cases involving corruption and conflict of interest that are brought by the Department of Justice’s <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-pin"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Public Integrity Section</a> (which also publishes annual reports, <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/criminal/criminal-pin/annual-reports"">2022</a> being the most recent) or state-level prosecutors. <br/>
<br/>
The primary defendants, typically government employees or officials, ranged from a U.S. Ambassador to an Army travel clerk, from an Assistant United States Attorney to a Contracting Officer. All but one had multiple co-conspirators, some charged and others not, who participated in or had knowledge of the scheme. One case involved representatives of a foreign government who secretly funded the government employee to engage in a covert lobbying campaign on their behalf.  <br/>
<br/>
The value of their schemes varied; one example was a scheme that was identified prior to the agency awarding funds (although more than $450,000 in administrative costs were lost and thus unable to obligate those funds). In one bribery scheme, the defendant received more than $38 million in bribes. The total loss or value of the schemes collectively was $40,587,775, or an average of $5 million. Removing the outlier, the average was $301,821. <br/>
<br/>
Sentences were as varied as the schemes themselves. One low-level Army employee received 29 days of prison time (versus his co-conspirator, who received 18 months). The <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/17/politics/retired-fbi-agent-charles-mcgonigal-sentenced/index.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">former FBI Special Agent in Charge</a> who created a scheme to receive a $225,000 “loan” from a foreign business associate received 28 months in prison and a U.S. Air Force <a href=""https://www.osi.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3374169/former-af-civilian-gets-15-year-prison-sentence-for-fraud/"">contracting officer representative</a> received 188 months (largely based on the substantial loss of more than $38 million). <br/>
<h2>Types of Schemes</h2>
Over these cases, the types of schemes or methods of corruption were assorted, primarily depending on the main issue involved. As anticipated, conflicts of interest between their obligations as a government employee and a relationship was the most common issue. In most cases, the relationship was with a spouse (3) or a business associate (3). In one unique case, it was with their own false reporting to their agency which enabled the conflict and theft scheme (see below for the case).  In another case, it was a procurement fraud scheme that failed before it got off the ground. Two cases involved bribery. <br/>
<br/>
The case described above involving fraud and theft by a senior member of the National Park Service is worth an in-depth look. In 2021, the <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-vi/pr/national-park-service-official-arrested-theft-and-fraud-charges"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">United States Attorney announced</a> an indictment against the man, who was an acting Park Superintendent in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Using his position, the man failed to pay the required rent for his government housing for more than a year. He also directed a subordinate to change the housing classification to lessen the rent that was required to pay. If that was not enough, he also allegedly submitted a change of duty station voucher that falsely reflected he was relocating his wife and four children to St. Croix in August 2019 (which never occurred, they were still living in Florida). He also submitted overlapping travel vouchers. He was ultimately <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-vi/pr/national-park-service-deputy-superintendent-sentenced-fraud-case"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">sentenced </a>in April 2024 to home detention, probation and restitution.   <br/>
<br/>
Another interesting case involved a <a href=""https://oig.opm.gov/sites/default/files/media/document/2023-09/Spann-Press-Release.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Contracting Officer</a> from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. She and her husband had formed companies that had received government contractors for years; then she was hired by OPM in 2007. Beginning in around 2011, she began to direct government contracts worth millions of dollars to her husband and his companies, despite being prohibited from participating in government decisions in which she or her husband had a financial interest. The <a href=""https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.253818/gov.uscourts.dcd.253818.15.0.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">government’s sentencing memorandum</a> describes the multiple instances in which she had been instructed in the law of conflict of interest and the lengths she took to conceal her interest in her husband’s companies and his dealings. <br/>
<h2>A Fraud Prevented</h2>
It is rare to find a case prosecuted where fraud was prevented prior to its full execution. But the case of Kevin Kuciapinski and his co-conspirators is complex, but interesting. Some of the background can be found in this <a href=""https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.171823.1.0.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">affidavit for an email search warrant</a> filed in the case. Over the course of a year, the active-duty U.S. Air Force major worked with a co-conspirator to obtain a government contract that would benefit  Kuciapinski’s then-wife, who owned a company that sought to do business with the Government. Kuciapinski, to aid their scheme, provided technical advice on various occasions to his then-wife (whom he filed for divorce later in 2014). There are certainly some valuable lessons all fraud examiners can draw from it, including the importance of prevention, training, documentation and oversight. <br/>
<br/>
Conflicts of interest are inherently a difficult type of fraud examination to undertake. They are often shrouded in secrecy, purposefully designed by the participants to evade detection.  But understanding how these cases have progressed is important for all CFEs to understand. First, it can show the “slippery slope” of unethical behavior, which slowly descends into more serious crimes. It also shows the consequences when individuals engage in illegal activity and the impact they can have on parties who are not part of the scheme. The victims are not only the government, the taxpayers and the public institutions, but also many others (both directly and indirectly) who suffer when integrity is breached for personal gain.

52,<h1>Uncovering Conflict and Kickback Fraud: A Case Study in the Automobile Industry</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Anuj Choudhary,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>In recent years, multinational automobile manufacturers have faced escalating challenges with fraud within their supply chain divisions. This article presents a detailed case study of a leading automobile company that undertook a comprehensive investigation into allegations of kickbacks, conflicts of interest among its vendors and employees, and theft of high-quality automotive paint. <br/>
<br/>
Amid operational concerns and suspicious activities within the supply chain division, the company initiated an internal inquiry. Red flags, including unusual vendor relations and discrepancies in inventory management, prompted management to delve deeper into potential misconduct. Below are the allegations: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whistleblower Allegations:</strong> Allegations emerged regarding improper financial benefits received by certain employees from vendors in exchange for favorable treatment and contracts. </li>
<li><strong>Theft of High-Value Items:</strong> An incident involving the theft of high-quality automotive paint and other spares triggered an extensive review to determine past occurrences and assess weaknesses in inventory control measures. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Modus Operandi </h2>
<p>The scheme began with the identification of high-value items. Employees within the company identified high-quality paint and coatings as valuable due to their high cost and strong demand in both legitimate and black markets. Leveraging their insider knowledge, employees working in the paint storage and application departments had detailed information about </p>
<p>inventory levels, shipment schedules and storage procedures. This insider access gave them the upper hand in selecting and targeting these high-value items. <br/>
<br/>
To facilitate the theft, the employees engaged in manipulating records. They falsified delivery and inventory records, deliberately recording fewer paint containers than were actually delivered. This tactic created a surplus that they could exploit. In addition, they orchestrated phantom shipments by creating false shipment orders and documentation, which indicated that specific amounts of paint were shipped to non-existent locations or for non-existent orders. This further obscured their actions and maintained the appearance of legitimate operations. <br/>
<br/>
For the physical removal of the stolen goods, employees with authorized access to the storage areas strategically chose to remove containers during shifts when security was minimal, such as late-night or early-morning hours. They also employed smuggling techniques to transport the stolen paint out of the facility, using personal vehicles or company transport under the guise of routine business operations. These methods minimized the risk of detection and facilitated the smooth removal of stolen goods. <br/>
<br/>
Once the paint was removed, the employees moved to the distribution and sale phase. They colluded with external body shops and resellers willing to buy the stolen paint at discounted prices, enabling them to offload the stolen goods quickly. They also established a network of buyers, including independent auto repair shops and small-scale car detailing businesses that preferred high-quality paint but wanted to avoid the cost associated with legitimate purchase channels. This network ensured a steady demand for the stolen paint. <br/>
<br/>
To cover their tracks, the employees repeated the process in small, undetectable quantities to avoid raising immediate suspicion. Large thefts would have triggered audits and investigations, so they kept each instance small and subtle. Furthermore, they engaged in record tampering to ensure that inventory records matched the falsified documents, making it appear that inventory levels were correct during regular checks. This meticulous attention to detail helped them avoid detection for an extended period. <br/>
<br/>
A series of detailed work procedures were conducted to investigate the allegations of misconduct. Common opening procedures for both allegations involved collaborating with operational stakeholders to review existing policies and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) related to inventory management, identifying gaps and weaknesses that may have been exploited. Additionally, eDiscovery procedures were initiated to collect electronic data relevant to the suspected employees and vendors, preserving evidence for forensic analysis. <br/>
<br/>
The investigation split into two specific allegations. In Allegation 1: Conflict of Interest and Vendor Relations, forensic procedures were conducted to extract and analyze electronic data from devices used by the suspected employees. This analysis revealed instances of vendor favoritism and undisclosed financial transactions. A financial investigation followed, examining bank records that uncovered significant cash deposits in accounts linked to the suspected employees. This prompted further investigation into potential financial improprieties. Physical asset discoveries during on-site visits and inquiries disclosed undisclosed property acquisitions by the implicated employees, raising suspicions of conflicts of interest. <br/>
<br/>
For Allegation 2: Theft of High-Quality Automotive Paint, the investigation involved the compilation and creation of a data lake from various sources, including sales records, weighment records, and inventory logs. This unified dataset enabled comprehensive analysis. Advanced data analysis techniques, using tools like SQL and SSIS, helped identify patterns and anomalies, with statistical methods used for reconciliation and root cause analysis. A systematic sample selection of transactions was conducted to ensure unbiased representation and detect irregularities. Subsequently, anomaly detection was carried out using advanced analytics tools to identify fraud patterns within transactions, which validated the initial findings. <br/>
<br/>
Transaction testing was also a critical component of the investigation. Rigorous testing on sample sales transactions was conducted to validate the initial findings of irregularities and discrepancies. This phase was essential to substantiate the evidence gathered during the analysis. <br/>
<br/>
The common closure procedures included interviews with relevant custodians, which provided further insights. Employees and vendors revealed critical details during these interviews, disclosing that vendor employees engaged in daily theft of goods in small quantities and subsequently adjusted to shortages through collusive actions. Following these revelations, all pertinent documents were retrieved from the vendors, and a forensic claim computation was conducted. The computation revealed losses totaling INR 18.5 million, compounded with accrued interest, resulting in a cumulative financial impact of INR 22.5 million. Finally, a comprehensive fact-finding review report was presented to senior management, outlining the issues uncovered and recommending corrective measures, including strategies to strengthen inventory security and enhance monitoring protocols. </p>
<h2>Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) </h2>
<p>Post-investigation, the company implemented several CAPA to address vulnerabilities and mitigate future risks: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy Revisions and Implementation:</strong> Updated policies and procedures to address identified vulnerabilities and strengthen internal controls. </li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Monitoring and Reporting:</strong> Introduction of enhanced monitoring and reporting mechanisms to proactively identify and address potentially fraudulent activities, such as the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for auto case identification and alerts. </li>
<li><strong>Training and Development Initiatives:</strong> Launch of targeted training initiatives aimed at enhancing employee awareness and compliance with company policies and ethical standards. </li>
<li><strong>Separation of Involved Employees:</strong> Immediate separation of employees involved in the fraud. </li>
<li><strong>Financial Penalties on Vendors:</strong> Implementation of strict financial penalties on vendors involved in the conflict of interest, totaling INR 22.5 million, and termination of business relationships with these vendors. </li>

56,"<h1>Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship Recipient: Isaac Asamoah Amponsah, CFE</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Isaac Asamoah Amponsah, CFE, is one of the exceptional recipients of the 2024-2025 <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/about-the-acfe/acfe-foundation/scholarship"">Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship</a>. Recognizing that the time was right to take a significant step forward in his professional journey, Amponsah decided to apply for the scholarship. Motivated by the potential for recognition, professional growth and networking within the anti-fraud community, he seized the opportunity, seeing it not just as financial support but as a catalyst for future career advancement and impact in the field of anti-fraud. <br/>
<h2>How did you hear about the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship? What made you decide to apply? </h2>
I first became aware of the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship through emails from the ACFE Foundation, which started arriving in my inbox as early as 2021. Initially, I did not pay much attention to these invitations, perhaps because I was not fully ready to take that next step in my professional journey. However, something changed on September 18, 2023, when I received another email invitation. This time, I felt a strong conviction that the timing was right and that applying for the scholarship could be a crucial turning point in my career. <br/>
<br/>
One of the main reasons I decided to apply was the recognition and professional advancement that I observed in past recipients. I had noticed that winning this scholarship often led to enhanced visibility on professional networks like LinkedIn, which is particularly important in a field like anti-fraud, where the vital work we do can sometimes go unnoticed. The scholarship represented not just financial support but also an opportunity to gain recognition, connect with other professionals in the field and enhance my credibility and career prospects in the anti-fraud community. <br/>
<h2>How did you become passionate about fighting fraud? </h2>
My passion for fighting fraud is something that has been with me for as long as I can remember. Much like how professionals in fields such as addiction recovery often find their calling through personal experiences, I believe that my drive to combat fraud is something innate, a core part of who I am. From a very young age, I was acutely aware of the injustice caused by dishonesty. I saw how undeserving individuals could manipulate situations to their advantage, taking what was not rightfully theirs and, in doing so, depriving others who genuinely needed those resources. This sense of unfairness deeply resonated with me and planted the seeds of my commitment to fighting fraud. <br/>
<br/>
My passion was further fueled when I enrolled in a Fraud Examination course from West Virginia University on Coursera in 2020. The course opened my eyes to the complexities of fraud, especially through Cressey’s <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/fraud-101-what-is-fraud"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Fraud Triangle</a>, which explains the psychological and situational factors that lead individuals to commit fraud. Understanding these dynamics not only deepened my resolve but also provided me with the tools and knowledge to approach fraud prevention and detection more effectively. The course reinforced my belief that combating fraud is not just about following rules; it is about protecting resources, ensuring fairness and upholding integrity in every sphere of life. <br/>
<h2>What advice do you have for students who are interested in applying for the scholarship? </h2>
If you are considering applying for the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship, my advice is simple: do not hesitate. This scholarship is more than just financial aid; it is a gateway to numerous professional opportunities. For me, receiving the scholarship was a pivotal moment. Just two months after being named one of the 2024-2025 recipients, I went on to become a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE), a credential that has significantly boosted my career. The recognition that comes with this scholarship has opened doors I had not even considered before—I have been approached by professionals and organizations interested in my research and eager to collaborate. <br/>
<br/>
Beyond the scholarship itself, I strongly recommend getting involved with the ACFE and your local chapters. The ACFE offers a wealth of resources, including webinars, training sessions and networking events that are invaluable for anyone serious about a career in anti-fraud. Being active in your local chapter also allows you to build professional relationships and find mentors who can guide you on your journey. <br/>
<br/>
If you are still a student, take advantage of anti-fraud activities on campus, such as ACFE Student Chapters. Engaging in these activities not only strengthens your application but also gives you practical experience that will be invaluable in your career. Remember, the field of anti-fraud is one where continuous learning and networking are key and this scholarship can be the springboard that launches your career to new heights. So take the leap, apply and make the most of the opportunities that come your way. <br/>

57,"<h1>Chase Bank ""Money Glitch"" Trend is Just Plain Check Fraud</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                The Chase Bank <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/business/chase-tiktok-trend/index.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">""money glitch"" trend</a> recently gained traction on social media platforms, where influencers and scammers misled many into believing they can get free money from banks by exploiting a so-called ""glitch."" However, this “trend” is actually a form of check fraud that can have serious legal and financial repercussions for those involved. <br/>
<h2>Rise of the ""Money Glitch"" Trend </h2>
The trend, primarily spread on TikTok, YouTube and other social media platforms, claims that users can exploit a flaw in Chase Bank’s systems to obtain money without having sufficient funds in their accounts. Videos and posts often portray the process as a get-rich-quick scheme, with individuals boasting about receiving thousands of dollars effortlessly. The supposed method involves depositing bad checks into their accounts, then quickly withdrawing the funds before the bank detects the fraudulent activity. <br/>
<br/>
Scammers entice viewers by showing screenshots or videos of large account balances, followed by vague instructions on how to achieve similar results. In some cases, they offer to sell step-by-step guides or charge a fee to personally walk people through the so-called “glitch,” which further perpetuates the fraud. The allure of easy money is powerful, especially for individuals in financial distress or those who are simply unaware of the legal implications. <br/>
<h2>A Modern Twist on Classic Check Fraud </h2>
<p>
Check fraud is not a new phenomenon; it has been a criminal activity for decades and famously popularized by <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=resurgence-of-check-fraud-frank-abagnale-jr"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Frank Abagnale Jr.</a>, whose exploits were dramatized in the movie “Catch Me If You Can”. Bearing a striking resemblance to Abagnale Jr.’s tactics, this supposed ""glitch"" is nothing more than a modern twist on classic check fraud. </p>
<p>Here is how check fraud typically works: Fraudsters deposit a check that is either fake or altered into their account using a mobile deposit feature. Banks, including Chase, often allow customers to access a portion of the funds immediately, even before the check is fully cleared. Scammers then withdraw or transfer the available funds before the bank realizes that the check is bad. Once the check is flagged as fraudulent or bounced, the bank reverses the deposit, leaving the account holder responsible for repaying the money. <br/>
<br/>
In many cases, these checks are stolen, forged or drawn on closed accounts, and unsuspecting participants in the trend are often unaware that they are not only committing fraud but also stealing funds from other people's accounts. This reckless behavior can lead to overdraft fees, account closures and criminal charges. Those who think they are simply “beating the system” are setting themselves up for a legal nightmare. </p>
<h2>The High Price of Chasing the “Glitch” </h2>
Participating in this trend is not only unethical but also illegal. Check fraud is a federal crime in the United States, and those caught can face severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Banks like Chase have sophisticated fraud detection systems that eventually catch up with these activities, and individuals involved are typically held liable for the full amount of the fraudulent transactions, plus any additional fees. <br/>
<br/>
Engaging in check fraud damages your banking history and can result in being blacklisted by financial institutions, making it extremely difficult to open new accounts, secure loans or even rent a home in the future. For young people, particularly those unaware of the gravity of their actions, the consequences can be life-altering. A criminal record for fraud can affect job prospects, educational opportunities and overall financial stability. <br/>
<h2>“Glitch” Busting: Banks and Legal Actions </h2>
<p>
Banks, including Chase, are actively working to combat this trend by enhancing their fraud detection capabilities and cooperating with law enforcement. Chase has issued warnings and reminders to its customers that there are no “glitches” that allow people to bypass banking rules legally. They are also monitoring suspicious activity closely and freezing accounts involved in fraudulent transactions. <br/>
<br/>
Law enforcement agencies are also taking action, investigating individuals who promote or participate in this scam. Authorities have issued warnings that those involved in this so-called “trend” will face arrests and charges related to fraud. This crackdown serves as a warning that what may appear as a harmless or clever trick to get quick cash is, in fact, a serious criminal offense. </p>
<p>It is crucial for individuals, especially younger audiences who are most targeted by these scams, to understand that there are no shortcuts to wealth that do not come with significant risks. Legitimate financial growth comes from hard work, saving, investing wisely and managing money responsibly—not from exploiting supposed “glitches” that are nothing more than illegal schemes. <br/>
<br/>
The Chase ""money glitch"" trend is a reminder of the dangers of blindly following viral content without understanding the potential consequences. Always be skeptical of anyone promising easy money, especially when it involves bending the rules of established institutions like banks. In the end, the real glitch is believing that crime does not come with a cost. </p>

On July 19, 2024, CrowdStrike pushed out an update to one of its programs, a vulnerability scanning tool called Falcon Sensor, which contained a significant bug. For computers running on a Microsoft Windows operating system, this faulty update caused the computer to crash. The systems would then be unable to reboot successfully, continually running into errors in the Falcon software and rendering the computer inoperable. Microsoft would later estimate that approximately 8.5 million devices were directly affected. Organizations across all variety of industries lost access to critical systems, including airlines, public transit systems in multiple cities, hospitals and clinics, financial institutions, and media outlets around the world. The total global cost is estimated in the billions of dollars. It is the largest information technology (IT) outage in history.  <br/>
<br/>
CrowdStrike purportedly identified the issue and deployed a fix within hours. Unfortunately, restoring individual computers required hands-on implementation, manually booting affected systems and remedying the issue. While most critical systems were repaired within a day, some organizations took significantly longer to fully recover.  <br/>
<h2>The Opportunity </h2>
Despite the rapid response time and the availability of solutions directly from CrowdStrike and Microsoft, fraudsters smelled an opportunity. As is always the case with disasters, outages, tragedies and other well publicized events, malicious actors will find ways to try to take advantage of people already in distress. Easy similarities can be made to <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/covid-19-benchmarking-report"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">COVID pandemic fraud</a>, <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/after-storms-watch-out-scams"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">natural disaster scams</a> or even <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/tax-season-phone-scams-and-taxpayer-id-theft"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">tax season fraud</a> (which may not be a traditional disaster, but certainly results in many distressed citizens).  <br/>
<br/>
CrowdStrike recovery scams started immediately. In the days following the outage, CrowdStrike itself released information on <a href=""https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/malicious-inauthentic-falcon-crash-reporter-installer-spearphishing/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">identified spear phishing attempts</a>. The company also <a href=""https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-sensor-issue-use-to-target-crowdstrike-customers/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">released information on general malicious activity</a> surrounding the event.  <br/>
<br/>
Fraud examiners will recognize these commonly used attacks: malicious emails, scam phone calls and fake websites targeting companies reporting outages and their employees. Fraudsters posed as technical support or CrowdStrike staff offering refunds or remuneration for losses caused by the outage. The well publicized outage gave fraudsters an easy list of targets. As organizations added themselves to the growing list of businesses and government agencies that were temporarily unavailable, they were also painting themselves, and their customers, with targets. <br/>
<br/>
Emails were sent to known corporate addresses with malicious attachments. The emails posed as CrowdStrike, Microsoft or other technical support staff sharing important recovery information. An attached PDF promised to contain the method to restore crashed systems, or a download link promised to install a program that would protect as-yet unaffected systems. Websites were created within hours of the first major outage reports, using URLs similar to real CrowdStrike websites to steal information from unwary users or to host malicious software posing as solutions. Fake CrowdStrike social media sites cropped up, linking to malicious websites or asking for users to message the fraudsters posing as support through the social media platform.  <br/>
<br/>
While not as directly connected, frauds and scams targeted at customers of businesses affected by the outage also see an increase. For example, airlines affected by the outage began issuing refunds to customers whose flights were cancelled. Fraudsters posing as the airline, aware of the outage, identify customers on social media posting about delays, cancellations or venting their frustration in the public forum. The fraudster then provides links to fake websites, fake social media accounts or phishes with targeted emails, phone calls or instant messages, convincing the customer their refund is just a few clicks away, they just need to provide their credit card information to process the refund.  <br/>
<h2>The Takeaway </h2>
These kinds of events are inevitable, and fraudsters will always look to take advantage of them. Unfortunately, even with sound and consistent anti-fraud training for organizations and individuals, disasters and stress limit our attention to detail and make us more susceptible to hasty actions. Fraud examiners must <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=top-5-fraud-trends-of-2024"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">stay ahead of the wave</a>, reacting to situations appropriately with timely reminders to remain cautious and to look for solutions or assistance through secure channels. These scams are usually quick and dirty, so remind staff, friends and family of their traditional cyber security scrutiny: check the URLs, email addresses and usernames and avoid clicking links or downloading attachments. It is easy to do on a well-caffeinated, calm morning at the office, but significantly harder when you are stranded after a flight cancellation, your bank’s website is down, and you are hastily scrolling for solutions.

59,<h1>Lessons Learned from Historical Frauds</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Fraud has plagued businesses throughout history, leaving a trail of financial ruin and shattered reputations in its wake. While each fraud case is unique, they often share common threads that modern-day businesses can learn from. By examining some of the most notorious historical frauds and integrating insights from the ACFE’s <em><a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/?utm_source=acfeinsights&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=20248-ACFEInsights-Aug20"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Occupational Fraud 2024: A Report to the Nations</a></em>, businesses can better protect themselves from similar pitfalls today. The report reveals that more than half of occupational frauds occur due to lack of internal controls or an override of existing controls, highlighting the critical need for effective fraud prevention measures.  <br/>
<h2>Enron Corporation </h2>
In the early 2000s, <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/updates/enron-scandal-summary/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Enron Corporation</a>, once a Wall Street energy giant, collapsed in one of the most infamous corporate fraud cases in history. The company engaged in elaborate accounting schemes to hide debt and inflate profits, fooling investors and regulators alike. Enron’s executives, led by CEO Jeffrey Skilling and Chairman Kenneth Lay, used mark-to-market accounting to record projected future profits as actual earnings. This illusion of profitability drove stock prices sky-high, but the reality was quite the opposite. When the truth was uncovered, Enron’s stock plummeted, and the company filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions in shareholder value.  <br/>
<h2>Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi Scheme </h2>
Bernie Madoff, a former NASDAQ chairman, orchestrated what would become the <a href=""https://www.nasaa.org/4303/madoff-a-21st-century-ponzi-scheme/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">largest Ponzi scheme</a> in history, defrauding investors out of an estimated $65 billion. Madoff promised consistent, above-market returns, attracting thousands of investors, including celebrities, charities and financial institutions. However, rather than generating legitimate profits, Madoff used new investments to pay returns to earlier investors, creating a façade of success. The scheme unraveled in 2008 when Madoff confessed, leading to his arrest and the devastation of countless lives and fortunes.  <br/>
<h2>The Savings and Loan Crisis </h2>
In the 1980’s, the <a href=""https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/savings-and-loan-crisis"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Savings and Loan (S&amp;L)</a> industry in the United States faced a widespread collapse due to risky lending practices and inadequate regulatory oversight. S&amp;Ls, originally designed to promote homeownership by offering affordable mortgages, began engaging in high-risk investments and speculative real estate deals. With deregulation in the early 1980’s, these institutions took on excessive risk, often with little regard for the potential consequences. As real estate markets collapsed, many S&amp;Ls became insolvent, leading to a taxpayer-funded bailout of more than $100 billion.  <br/>
<h2>Wirecard Scandal </h2>
In 2020, the <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/how-the-biggest-fraud-in-german-history-unravelled"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Wirecard scandal</a> came to light as one of the most significant corporate frauds in European history. Wirecard, a German payment processing company, was found to have falsified accounts and inflated revenues by more than GBP 1.9 billion. The company’s executives, including CEO Markus Bruan, were involved in creating fake transactions and misrepresenting the company’s financial health to investors. The scandal led to the insolvency of Wirecard and criminal investigations against its top executives. The case also raised concerns about the effectiveness of financial regulation and oversight in Germany.  <br/>
<h2>Lessons for Modern-Day Businesses </h2>
<p>Reflecting on these historical frauds, several key lessons emerge for modern businesses: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transparency and Integrity:</strong> Honest and transparent financial reporting is essential. The ACFE’s <em>Occupational Fraud 2024: A Report to the Nations</em> confirms that lack of internal controls and oversight can lead to significant fraud risks, making transparency a critical component of financial management.  </li>
<li><strong>Due Diligence and Vigilance:</strong> Conduct thorough due diligence and maintain a healthy level of skepticism. Effective anti-fraud controls are associated with lower fraud losses and quicker detection. </li>
<li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Implement strong risk management practices. The S&amp;L crisis shows the dangers of inadequate oversight, highlighting the need for robust risk management to prevent financial crises.  </li>
<li><strong>Governance and Ethics:</strong> Foster a culture of ethical behavior and strong corporate governance. The Wirecard scandal underscores the importance of ethical leadership and internal controls in preventing fraud.  </li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Adhere to regulations and advocate for robust oversight. Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements help prevent systemic failures and strengthens defenses against fraud. </li>
</ol>
<p>By learning from these historical mistakes, modern businesses should understand why these lessons are pertinent to learn from and take steps to ensure those same mistakes are not happening under their noses. Integrity, accountability and vigilance are as relevant today as ever, maintaining trust and achieving lasting success in today’s competitive business environment.  </p>

60,<h1>Empowering Fraud Victims: Resources and Strategies for Recovery</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Fraud investigation involves more than just uncovering financial discrepancies and bringing perpetrators to justice. It is essential to address the profound emotional and psychological impacts fraud can have on victims. Financial loss is often accompanied by feelings of betrayal, shame and trauma, which can linger long after the fraudulent activity has been discovered and reported. While support groups play a critical role, there are additional resources and strategies that can further aid in the recovery process for fraud victims. </p>
<h2>Understanding the Emotional Impact </h2>
<p>
Fraud is not just about the money lost; it is about the trust broken and the sense of security shattered. Victims often experience a range of emotions, from anger and disbelief to guilt and embarrassment. As investigators, acknowledging these feelings and providing empathetic support can significantly affect the recovery process. 
</p>
<h2>Beyond Support Groups: Comprehensive Recovery Resources </h2>
<ol>
<li>Counseling Services: Professional counseling can provide fraud victims with a safe space to process their emotions and develop coping strategies. Many victims benefit from speaking with therapists who specialize in financial trauma or fraud-related cases. </li>
<li>Legal Aid: Access to legal advice and representation is crucial for fraud victims navigating the complexities of recovery. Organizations like Legal Aid offer free or low-cost services to help victims understand their rights and options. </li>
<li>Financial Counseling: Rebuilding financial stability after a fraud incident can be daunting. Financial counselors can assist victims in creating a recovery plan, managing debt and rebuilding credit. Services like those offered by the <a href=""https://www.nfcc.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">National Foundation for Credit Counseling</a> (NFCC) can be invaluable.</li>
<li>Educational Workshops: Knowledge is empowering. Educational workshops can equip victims with the tools to protect themselves from future fraud. Topics may include recognizing red flags, understanding common fraud schemes and learning preventive measures. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Building a Supportive Community </h2>
<p>Creating a supportive community is essential for fraud victims. Online forums, local meetups and social media groups can offer a sense of belonging and a platform to share experiences and advice. </p>
<ul>
<li>Online Forums and Communities: Websites like Reddit and dedicated forums for fraud victims provide an anonymous space for individuals to seek advice and share their stories.</li>
<li>Local Meetups: Organizing local meetups can help victims connect with others in their area who have experienced similar fraud incidents. These gatherings can foster a sense of community and mutual support. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fraud victims need more than just financial restitution; they need comprehensive support that addresses their emotional, psychological and educational needs. As investigators and advocates, we must recognize the multifaceted nature of fraud recovery and provide victims with the resources and strategies necessary to rebuild their lives. By doing so, we empower them to move forward with confidence and resilience. <br/>

61,<h1>Case Study: Uncovering Unethical Activities in an Indian IT and ITeS Firm</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Anuj Choudhary,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                In the dynamic landscape of the IT and information technology enabled services (ITeS) sector, upholding ethical standards is paramount for maintaining organizational integrity and safeguarding reputation. Ethical lapses could have profound consequences, necessitating thorough investigative measures to protect corporate interests. This article provides an overview of a comprehensive forensic investigation conducted for a prominent Indian firm in the IT and ITeS industry. The investigation was initiated to validate management's concerns regarding suspected unethical conduct by certain employees and to unearth concrete evidence. <br/>
<br/>
The client, a major player in the Indian IT and ITeS sector, specializes in delivering comprehensive technology solutions. Management harbored suspicions about unethical activities by specific employees and engaged our forensic team to conduct a thorough fact-finding review to assess these suspicions and gather corroborative evidence. <br/>
<br/>
The primary objective of this engagement was to conduct a comprehensive fact-finding review to verify the management’s suspicions and identify evidence of unethical activities by the suspected employees. This entailed examining compliance with employment contracts and the company’s code of ethics. <br/>
<h2>Investigation Approach </h2>
The investigation employed a methodical approach encompassing several steps.  We commenced with detailed consultations with the management to gain an in-depth understanding of their concerns and review any preliminary evidence. This included evaluating internal reports, employee records and pertinent communications. Forensic technology procedures were then crucially employed for preserving and analyzing potential digital evidence. We created forensic images of the electronic devices used by the suspected employees, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the data for subsequent analysis. <br/>
<br/>
A meticulous review of electronic data from the suspected employees’ devices followed, involving examination of emails, files and other digital communications for indications of unethical behavior. The investigation revealed multiple instances of confidential company information being shared with personal email addresses, constituting a clear breach of employment contracts and the company’s code of ethics. <br/>
<br/>
The digital forensics investigation uncovered compelling evidence that the suspected employees had established their own venture and were actively poaching the company’s existing customers. This not only represented a conflict of interest but also a significant breach of trust and confidentiality. Key Findings <br/>
The investigation led to several critical findings: <br/>
<br/>
Numerous instances were identified where confidential company information was sent to personal email addresses, violating employment contracts and the company’s code of ethics. <br/>
<br/>
Further checks post-employee’s consent on the personal email address noted leakages to the compete employees, who were to join suspected employees in new venture. <br/>
<br/>
Evidence indicated that the suspected employees had set up their own business venture, in direct competition with the client company, representing a clear conflict of interest.  <br/>
<br/>
The suspected employees were found to be soliciting the company’s existing clients, attempting to divert business to their own venture. This breach of ethical norms had the potential to cause substantial financial harm to the company. <br/>
<h2>Challenges Encountered </h2>
The investigation faced several significant challenges: The sheer volume of electronic data to be reviewed was substantial, necessitating the use of efficient data processing tools and techniques to sift through the information effectively. Upholding strict confidentiality throughout the investigation was imperative to comply with CFE Code of Professional Standards. This ensured that sensitive information pertaining to the investigation, including personal data of employees and proprietary company information, was safeguarded against unauthorized access or disclosure. <br/>
<br/>
Navigating the legal landscape was crucial, particularly regarding the privacy rights of the employees and the admissibility of digital evidence in potential legal proceedings. Managing internal resistance, such as information withholding or attempts to influence the investigation for political reasons, required robust leadership and transparency to maintain impartiality and integrity. 
<h2>Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) </h2>

62,<h1>Working Capital Schemes: 12 Shell Company Red Flags</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                By: Sumitra Raghavan<br/>
 <br/>
A company enjoying a credit limit of $10 million from a bank had turned bad, otherwise known as non-performing assets (NPAs). A preliminary investigation was conducted to understand the genuine reason for the degradation of the loan account. Allegations included the siphoning of funds by the borrower through the shell companies and improper monitoring of the account by the bank. The suspected borrower company was dealing in garments, while the suppliers were traders of animal husbandry products, revealing even more inconsistencies in the trade activities and additional evidence of round-tipping of transactions. <br/>
<br/>
Upon reviewing the account statements of the suspected borrower, it was found that there was minimal turnover in the account, it was frequently overdrawn, and the entity had only repaid the interest instead of routing of entire sales proceeds in the account. This led to the identification of several red flags that indicated potentially fraudulent activity.  <br/>
<h2>Red Flags to Identify the Round-Tipping of Transactions Through Shell Companies: </h2>
<ol>
<li>Frequent cyclic transactions with the entities engaged in different lines of activities. </li>
<li>Key persons of the entities remain common. </li>
<li>The shell entities form the major portion of the debtors of the primary entities. </li>
<li>There is no physical presence of the major trade partners. </li>
<li>Transaction between the entities takes place in rounded figures. </li>
<li>The shell entity has less share capital but undertakes to execute a high amount of work orders. </li>
<li>The shell entity remains debt-free to avoid due diligence and scrutiny by the lender. </li>
<li>Account turnover is not commensurate with sales. </li>
<li>Cost of sales remains disproportionate to the revenue. </li>
<li>The production capacity does not match with sales. </li>
<li>Delay in filing returns/ documents with statutory authorities. </li>
<li>High volume of non-trade transactions in the account. </li>
</ol>
<p>Red flags are the indicators that call for further scrutiny and examination. Even if the conduct otherwise appears to be genuine. In this case, the above red flags were ignored leading to credit risk, erosion of capital and degradation of business. </p>

63,<h1>Warning Signs to Look Out for in Package Delivery Scams</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, a majority of people turned to online shopping and delivering purchases directly to their home addresses. This rising trend in online shopping and home delivery has made package delivery scams increasingly prevalent, exploiting people's trust in legitimate shipping companies like FedEx, UPS or DHL. These scams often target individuals through text messages or emails, deceiving them into revealing personal information or making financial transactions under false pretenses. Understanding the warning signs associated with these scams is crucial to avoiding potential financial losses and identity theft. <br/>
<br/>
Package delivery scams typically involve fraudulent communications claiming to be from legitimate shipping companies. Scammers use various tactics to deceive recipients into believing they have a package waiting for delivery, a missed delivery attempt or an outstanding fee that needs to be paid. These messages often include links to fake websites that mimic the appearance of official shipping company websites. The primary goal of these scams is to trick individuals into providing personal information, such as credit card details or to install malicious software on their devices. <br/>
<h2>Red Flags to Watch For </h2>
<strong>Unsolicited Messages:</strong> Receiving unsolicited messages about package deliveries is a common red flag. Legitimate shipping companies typically only send notifications if you have opted in through their official channels. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Suspicious URLs:</strong> Be cautious of URLs in text messages or emails. Scammers often use URLs that mimic legitimate shipping company websites but with slight variations. Hover over links to preview the destination URL and ensure they lead to the official site. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Requests for Personal Information: </strong>Legitimate shipping companies do not ask for sensitive information such as social security numbers, credit card details or passwords via unsolicited messages. If a message requests that information, it is likely a scam. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Urgency and Threats:</strong> Scam messages often create a sense of urgency or threat, stating that failure to respond or act immediately will result in consequences like package return or additional charges. These tactics are designed to pressure you into making hasty decisions. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Unexpected Payment Requests:</strong> Be wary of messages requesting payment for delivery fees, customs charges or taxes unexpectedly. Legitimate shipping companies typically collect such fees at the time of delivery or through official notifications, not via unsolicited messages. <br/>
<h2>Preventative Measures </h2>
<strong>Verify Through Official Channels:</strong> Always verify the authenticity of messages by contacting the shipping company directly using contact information from their official website or customer service numbers. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Check Sender Addresses: </strong>Double check the sender's email address or phone number for slight alterations that mimic official contacts (e.g., ""upsdelivery@gmail.com"" instead of ""@ups.com""). <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Report Suspicious Activity:</strong> Report suspected scam messages to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your country's consumer protection agency. This helps authorities quickly act against fraudulent schemes. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Use Security Software:</strong> Ensure your devices have updated security software to protect against malware that may be included in scam messages. <br/>
<br/>
By being aware of the warning signs associated with package delivery scams, you can protect yourself from falling prey to these fraudulent schemes. Always verify the legitimacy of messages before taking any action and remember that legitimate shipping companies prioritize customer security and would never jeopardize it through unsolicited or suspicious communications. Taking these precautions can help you avoid potential financial losses and identity theft, ensuring a safer online shopping experience.

64,<h1>Ethics at Risk: Addressing Fraudulent Behavior in ABA Therapy</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                By: Isaac Asamoah Amponsah, CIGE <br/>
<br/>
In the specialized field of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy, which is crucial for improving behaviors in individuals with autism and other developmental conditions, the importance of adhering to ethical standards cannot be overstated. However, dishonest and fraudulent activities frequently jeopardize this field's credibility. Falsifying patient progress to obtain ongoing financing, hiring underqualified personnel and invoicing for treatments that were never rendered are some examples of these unethical schemes. These dishonest activities undermine patient, therapist and family trust while also endangering the therapeutic results for those who are most in need of assistance. Furthermore, they do a disservice to the field by casting doubt on the reliability and efficacy of ABA therapy. This article aims to investigate the causes of these unethical behaviors, the wide-ranging effects they have on all parties involved and the critical tactics for thwarting fraud to rebuild confidence and ABA therapy's integrity. The main purpose of applied behavior analysis therapy, a tried-and-true method supported by science, is to treat people with autism spectrum disorders. By using structured interventions and positive reinforcement, ABA aims to improve a variety of behaviors, including reading, social skills, communication and adaptive learning. This therapy's importance lies in its greatly improving the learning and quality of life of autistic people, enabling them to live more successfully every day. <br/>
<h2>Fraud Schemes in ABA Therapy </h2>
Fraudulent behavior in ABA therapy, such as falsifying patient records, double billing, billing for services not rendered, waiving copays, upcoding, kickbacks, billing improbable hours and employing unqualified individuals, severely undermine the treatment's efficacy and reliability. This behavior financially burdens families and damages the overall integrity and credibility of the therapy. The ramifications of such fraudulent schemes are profound. Immediate effects include setbacks in behavioral development for patients, while the broader consequences threaten the entire profession. Long-term implications include a loss of trust and credibility, which can erode professional standards and trigger stricter regulatory oversight. Additionally, legal and financial repercussions for practitioners and clinics involved in fraud can be severe. These encompass penalties, license revocations and even criminal charges, alongside substantial fines and potential bankruptcy for implicated institutions.  <br/>
<br/>
This situation underscores the need for rigorous ethical oversight in ABA to maintain its integrity and ensure its continued benefit to those it serves. ABA requires behavior analysts to maintain proper documentation of patient’s progress. The double billing scheme in ABA involves behavior analysts billing the same patient at school and at home for a single service provided. Some behavior analysts are also stealing patients' information through telemarketing schemes to phantom bill insurance companies.  <br/>
<br/>
Copayments are usually instituted to provide medically necessary services and the patient was present for such visits. Fee-forgiveness or waiving copays by behavior analysts might be indicative of billing for services not rendered. Upcoding in ABA involves behavior analysts billing the supervision code (CPT 97155) for a treatment service provided. Upcoding also involves billing individual ABA codes even though a group ABA therapy was performed. Kickbacks might be allowed in some industries, but in the health care industry, referring patients for monetary gains is highly prohibited. <br/>
<h2>ABA Therapy Fraud Case Studies </h2>
In addressing fraudulent practices within ABA, there have been notable case studies where interventions have successfully led to significant improvements and policy changes. One such case involved a therapy center where billing discrepancies were flagged by an oversight body, leading to a detailed audit. The intervention resulted in the implementation of stricter billing protocols and enhanced supervision of therapy sessions. This case highlighted the necessity for rigorous checks and prompted several therapy centers to adopt similar measures, thereby increasing overall transparency and accountability in billing practices.  <br/>
<br/>
Another case involved a whistleblower exposing the use of unqualified staff in an ABA clinic. The successful legal action taken against this clinic not only resulted in substantial fines but also heightened industry-wide awareness about the critical need for qualified personnel in therapy roles. These cases have been instrumental in influencing policy changes, such as the introduction of mandatory continuing education for ABA therapists and stricter credential verification processes, requirements of prior authorizations, ensuring that practitioners remain competent and ethical in their professional conduct. These examples underscore the importance of vigilance and proactive measures in maintaining the integrity of therapeutic practices in ABA. <br/>
<br/>
Continuous ethical vigilance is essential in ABA therapy to ensure that the treatment provided remains effective, trustworthy and aligned with the highest professional standards. Given the vulnerability of the client population—primarily individuals with autism—upholding ethical practices is not only a professional obligation but also a moral one. Misconduct or negligence can lead to significant setbacks in patient care and undermine public confidence in ABA services. <br/>
<br/>
To enhance ethical practices in ABA, several strategic recommendations can be implemented. First, enhanced regulatory oversight and stricter licensing requirements would ensure that only qualified and ethically sound practitioners are allowed to practice, thereby safeguarding patient interests. Secondly, the development of a standardized reporting system for unethical behavior is crucial. Such a system would facilitate the reporting and tracking of ethical breaches, making it easier to address malpractices swiftly and effectively. Lastly, increasing transparency with stakeholders—including patients, families and funding bodies—about therapy practices and outcomes is vital. This openness not only builds trust but also encourages accountability, as stakeholders are better informed and can hold practitioners to higher standards of ethical conduct. Together, these strategies would significantly strengthen the ethical foundation of ABA therapy, promoting a more trustworthy and effective practice environment.

66,<h1>Top 4 Internal Controls That Reduce Fraud Losses</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Proactive anti-fraud controls play a key role in an organization’s fight against fraud. While the presence of these mechanisms alone does not ensure that all fraud will be prevented, management’s commitment to and investment in targeted prevention and detection measures send a clear message to employees, vendors, customers and others about the organization’s anti-fraud stance. But what happens when controls are not present? What happens when budget cuts and shifting roles mean that some controls are overlooked or take a back seat to revenue and survival? <br/>
<br/>
<em><a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Occupational Fraud 2024: A Report to the Nations</a></em> not only identifies the top anti-fraud controls that can help protect organizations, but also illustrates what can happen when controls are weak or altogether missing. <br/>
<br/>
To help organizations understand the potential impact of various controls, we compared the median losses and median durations of the frauds in our study based on whether each specific control was present at the victim organization during the fraud’s occurrence. For every control examined, organizations that had the control in place experienced smaller fraud losses and detected frauds more quickly than organizations lacking that control. <br/>
<br/>
Below are the top four internal controls that reduce fraud losses and can improve detection: </p>
<ul>
<li>Surprise audits </li>
<li>Financial statement audits </li>
<li>Hotlines </li>
<li>Proactive data analysis </li>
</ul>
<p>These four anti-fraud controls were associated with a 50% or greater reduction in both fraud losses and fraud duration. Surprise audits, financial statement audits and proactive data analysis are all mechanisms that can be used to actively look for fraud, so their correlation with reduced fraud losses and duration stands to reason. In contrast, hotlines are less directly tied to fraud detection, but likely help increase the perception of detection and form the foundation for a holistic anti-fraud culture. <br/>
<br/>
With fraud on the rise due to the economic downturn and global pandemic, now is the time to invest in anti-fraud controls, not ignore them. Your bottom line depends on it. <br/>

67,<h1>Stolen Voices: The Dark Side of AI</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming an increasing problem not just for hackers and fraudsters, but also for identity theft. Recently, there have been an influx of deepfakes of celebrities, but not just their faces—their voices. <br/>
<br/>
It is a big trend on social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, to post AI-generated singing using an artist's voice to predict what one of their unreleased songs might sound like. For example, AI was capable of replicating <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@you_guyss/video/7359432448637177093?_t=8mz3AZWeis6&amp;_r=1"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Swift and Post Malone’s</a> voices to sing a fans prediction of what their collaborative unreleased song, “Fortnight,” would sound like. While it all seems playful and harmless, there is a dark side to this AI capability that is creeping up on actors' and singers' jobs. <br/>
<h2>What is AI Voice Theft/Deepfake? </h2>
AI voice theft, often referred to as deepfake audio, involves using artificial intelligence to replicate someone’s voice with astonishing accuracy. This technology employs sophisticated algorithms and neural networks to analyze and mimic the speech patterns, tone and cadence of a target individual. While deepfakes started with visual content, such as fake videos of celebrities or politicians, the advancement in audio deepfakes is now a pressing concern. <br/>
<br/>
This technology can be used for various purposes, ranging from creating entertaining content to committing fraud and identity theft. The misuse of AI-generated voices can lead to severe implications, including unauthorized financial transactions, manipulation and damage to personal and professional reputations. <br/>
<h2>How is this affecting the movie and television industry? </h2>
The movie and television industry are grappling with the impact of AI voice theft. Voice actors and dubbing artists are particularly vulnerable, as AI can now replicate their voices, potentially reducing the need for their services. This technology allows producers to generate dialogue for characters without requiring the actor to record it. Consequently, actors fear losing their jobs and the unique creative control they have over their performances. <br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the quality and emotional depth provided by human voice actors cannot be easily replicated by AI. Despite this, the cost-effectiveness and convenience of AI-generated voices present a significant temptation for producers, leading to ethical and economic dilemmas within the industry.  <br/>
<h2>Actors and AI: </h2>
Several high-profile actors have become involuntary participants in AI voice theft scenarios: <br/>
<h3>Scarlett Johansson </h3>
Scarlett Johansson’s legal team is demanding transparency from OpenAI regarding the development of an AI voice assistant named “Sky,” which Johansson claims sounds <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2024/05/20/1252495087/openai-pulls-ai-voice-that-was-compared-to-scarlett-johansson-in-the-movie-her"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">eerily similar to her own voice</a>. This issue surfaced after OpenAI’s live demonstration of the voice, leading many to draw comparisons to Johansson’s character in the 2013 film “Her.” Johansson revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously approached her about licensing her voice for the assistant, but she declined that offer. Johansson then went on to state that she was “shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference.” <br/>
<h3>Keanu Reeves </h3>
Keanu Reeves is actively <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/fraud-examiner-archives/fraud-examiner-article?s=april-2023-deepfakes-and-voice-technology"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">fighting against AI-generated fraud</a> through a notable partnership with HomeEquity Bank, featuring in a series of deepfake videos designed to raise public awareness about the dangers of deepfakes. This inventive campaign uses Reeves' recognizable face to highlight the importance of critically examining digital content and remaining vigilant against fraudsters leveraging advanced AI tools. Additionally, Reeves has taken <a href=""https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/ai-celebs-scarlett-johansson-anil-kapoor-tom-hanks-keanu-reeves-steven-spielberg-71698916545525.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">personal measures to combat the misuse of AI</a>, including a clause in his film contracts that prohibits the use of AI during any stage of production. Reflecting on the issue, Reeves remarked, ""When you give a performance in a film, you know you’re going to be edited, but you’re participating in that. If you go into deepfake land, it has none of your points of view. That’s scary.""  <br/>
<h3>Bad Bunny </h3>
Bad Bunny has expressed his outrage over a viral TikTok song, ""NostalgIA,"" which uses <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-67355245"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">AI to replicate his voice</a> alongside fake vocals from Justin Bieber and Daddy Yankee. In a WhatsApp post to his 19 million followers, he vehemently condemned the track, stating that anyone who liked the song should leave his group chat and adding, ""You don't deserve to be my friends. I don't want them on the tour either."" Bad Bunny used strong language to describe his disdain for the AI-generated song. There is a growing concern among artists about the misuse of AI technology to clone their voices without consent, echoing similar sentiments expressed by Drake and The Weeknd when their voices were cloned for the viral track ""Heart On My Sleeve."" While some in the industry see potential in AI for music creation, the ethical and legal implications of voice cloning remain contentious. <br/>
<h2>SAG-AFTRA Strike: </h2>
Background actors and extras were asked to spend a day being cloned for producers to use an <a href=""https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/sag-aftra-background-actors-artificial-intelligence-1235673432/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">AI version of them</a> in the background instead of hiring them and paying them for the days they would be there working. They were only offered compensation on the day of being cloned and would not be given any royalties for any production they were in. This practice raised so much concern over extras losing their jobs that it led to the SAG-AFTRA strike. <br/>
<h2>How does this affect the anti-fraud industry? </h2>
Even though it is still early in the AI evolution, it is crucial to be cautious about AI voice theft and deepfakes in the anti-fraud industry. While more recently, AI has been used to copy actors' and artists' voices, fraudsters could potentially utilize it to copy the voices of CEOs, high-level executives, or even people you know in order to scam you. This kind of AI-driven impersonation could lead to severe security breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information and financial fraud. <br/>
<br/>
Organizations and individuals must stay vigilant and adopt advanced verification methods to counteract the potential threats posed by AI-generated voice theft. <br/>
<br/>
While AI voice technology offers remarkable capabilities, its misuse presents significant ethical, economic and security challenges. Balancing innovation with protection against misuse is essential as society navigates the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence.

68,<h1>Defending Whistleblowers: Creating a Culture of Transparency Before the Tip Comes In</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                In a world where transparency often feels more like a buzzword than an actual practice, whistleblowers stand out as unsung heroes. They risk careers and livelihoods to ensure that organizations live up to their ethical standards. They expose corruption, fraud and misconduct, peeling back layers of secrecy to reveal the truth. But what happens when these truth-seekers are not protected? <br/>
<br/>
The ACFE's recently released <em><a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2024/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Occupational Fraud: 2024 A Report to the Nations</a></em> paints a clear picture: tip lines remain the most effective tool for detecting fraud, uncovering 43% of cases. Despite this, many organizations still lack effective protective measures for those willing to come forward. <br/>
<h2>Creating an Environment of Safety </h2>
A culture of integrity is fundamental to making whistleblowers feel secure. If employees do not believe leadership will protect them or are reluctant to speak up, they may remain silent. This culture must start from the top. When leaders genuinely embody the values they espouse and show they are not above scrutiny, they make honesty safe again. <br/>
<br/>
Accessible and reliable reporting channels are essential, whether through third-party hotlines, web platforms or encrypted email. Allowing anonymity is crucial; no one should have to worry that their name will be linked to sensitive tips. Yet, even the best channels can be undermined if poorly executed. They should be intuitive, user-friendly and accessible 24/7 because fraud does not follow regular office hours. <br/>
<h2>Building Trust in the System </h2>
Education is crucial in empowering whistleblowers. Employees need to understand their rights and protections through regular, interactive training programs. Policies should be clear and devoid of legalese, ensuring everyone knows that reporting misconduct is not just allowed but encouraged and that retaliation will not be tolerated. <br/>
<br/>
Investigations must be unbiased and above board. External oversight ensures impartiality while an empowered internal audit team should have the autonomy to investigate independently. Strong anti-retaliation measures should also be in place with strict consequences for those who try to silence whistleblowers. This demonstrates a zero-tolerance stance on retaliation. <br/>
<h2>Supporting and Celebrating Whistleblowers </h2>
A robust protection system also means providing legal counsel and mental health support. Reporting can be incredibly stressful, so counseling services should be considered. Additionally, celebrating whistleblowers through recognition programs can help shift perceptions, recognizing them as the guardians of integrity they truly are. <br/>
<br/>
Creating a safer environment for whistleblowers is not just about compliance; it is about fostering a workplace culture that values truth. Whistleblower protection must be more than a policy—it must be a commitment. The ACFE offers resources to help organizations build this culture, ensuring whistleblowers feel safe and empowered. <br/>
<h2>Leading by Example: Case Studies of Successful Whistleblower Programs </h2>
Organizations that have successfully implemented robust whistleblower programs provide a blueprint for others. Companies like Siemens and Volkswagen, which have faced significant scandals, have overhauled their internal reporting mechanisms and seen a positive shift in corporate culture. These organizations have invested in transparent communication, regular training and external audits to ensure the integrity of their processes. Their experiences highlight that while the journey towards a transparent culture is challenging, the rewards—enhanced trust, improved morale and a better reputation—are well worth the effort. By learning from these examples, other organizations can understand the tangible benefits of a robust whistleblower protection program and the critical role it plays in long-term success.

70,<h1>6 High-Profile Fraud Cases of the Past 6 Months</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Fraud cases seem to be a constant in our global financial landscape, often involving staggering amounts of money and complex, multifaceted schemes that capture the attention of the public and authorities alike. The first six months of 2024 have been no different, with several high-profile fraud cases coming to light. From massive corporate fraud in China to sophisticated cryptocurrency thefts and international scam networks, these cases underline the persistent challenges in combating financial crime.  </p>
<h2>1. Evergrande: China Accused Troubled Property Developer of Financial Fraud in $78 Billion Case </h2>
<h3><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/19/business/china-evergrande-fraud-csrc-investigation-hnk-intl/index.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">CNN</a>: March 19, 2024 </h3>
Chinese regulators accused Evergrande, one of the country's largest property developers, of inflating revenues by $78 billion, marking the largest financial fraud case in mainland China's securities markets history. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) imposed a hefty penalty of CNY 4.175 billion (USD 580 million) on Hengda Real Estate, the group's main Chinese unit. Additionally, Evergrande's founder, Xu Jiayin, once China's richest man, was fined CNY 47 million (USD 6.5 million) and banned from the securities markets for life. The accusations stemmed from an eight-month investigation revealing that the company had fabricated 214 billion yuan (USD 30 billion) in sales for 2019 and another CNY 350 billion (USD 48.6 billion) in sales for 2020. These falsified figures significantly inflated Evergrande's net profits, ultimately leading to severe penalties and the company's forced liquidation ordered by a Hong Kong court in January 2024. 
<h2>2. ‘Super Villain’ of $6 Billion Fraud Was Key to U.K. Laundering Trial, Lawyer Said </h2>
<h3><a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-01/-super-villain-of-6-billion-fraud-is-key-to-uk-laundering-trial-lawyer-says"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Bloomberg</a>: March 1, 2024 </h3>
In the U.K., a woman named Jian Wen faced trial for allegedly laundering vast amounts of Bitcoin into cash. Her lawyer argued that Jian was manipulated by a “super villain,” Yadi Zhang (known as Zhimin Qian in China), who masterminded a USD 6 billion investment fraud in China. Jian, who unknowingly aided in the laundering operation, had her home raided by police who seized Bitcoin worth more than GBP 1.7 billion (USD 2.1 billion). The court heard how Zhang, a master of deception, created ten investment vehicles, scamming approximately 130,000 investors in China. Jian's lawyers contended that she was an unwitting participant, controlled by Zhang’s charisma and deceit. Zhang fled the U.K. in 2020, just before she was due for questioning, leaving Jian to face the consequences of the fraud. 
<h2>3. Ippei Mizuhara Charged with Bank Fraud in Criminal Complaint </h2>
<h3><a href=""https://www.mlb.com/news/ippei-mizuhara-charged-with-bank-fraud-in-criminal-complaint"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">MLB</a>: April 11, 2024 </h3>
Ippei Mizuhara, the former translator for MLB star Shohei Ohtani, was charged with bank fraud for illegally transferring more than USD 16 million from Ohtani's bank account to settle gambling debts. Mizuhara, who was dismissed by the Dodgers following the revelations, faced up to 30 years in federal prison if convicted. According to the United States Attorney for the Central District of California, Mizuhara carried out unauthorized wire transfers between November 2021 and January 2024, manipulating bank records and impersonating Ohtani to facilitate the fraud. Investigators found no evidence suggesting Ohtani's involvement in the fraudulent activities, confirming his status as a victim. 
<h2>4. U.S. Brothers Arrested for Stealing $25 Million in Crypto in Just 12 Seconds </h2>
<h3><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-69018575"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">BBC</a>: May 15, 2024 </h3>
Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, brothers and MIT graduates, were charged with wire fraud and money laundering after allegedly stealing USD 25 million in Ethereum cryptocurrency in a matter of seconds. The U.S. Department of Justice highlighted this as the first case of its kind, emphasizing the brothers' sophisticated understanding of Ethereum's transaction validation process. Their scheme involved intercepting and altering pending private transactions to siphon off the funds. When approached by Ethereum representatives, the brothers refused to return the stolen funds and instead attempted to launder them. If convicted, they each faced more than 20 years in prison. 
<h2>5. Hundreds Rescued from Love Scam Centre in the Philippines </h2>
<h3><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68562643"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">BBC</a>: March 14, 2024 </h3>
A raid on a scam center in the Philippines led to the rescue of hundreds of people forced to engage in ""love scams."" These scams, also known as ""pig butchering"" scams, involved luring victims into fake romantic relationships to defraud them. The raid, which freed 383 Filipinos, 202 Chinese and 73 other foreign nationals, was initiated after a Vietnamese man escaped and reported his ordeal. Victims were tricked into posing as online lovers to steal money and personal information from unsuspecting targets. Authorities found evidence of torture and harsh conditions for those trapped in the scam center, underscoring the severe human cost of these operations. 
<h2>6. Chinese Network Behind One of World’s ‘Largest Online Scams’ </h2>
<h3><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/may/08/chinese-network-behind-one-of-worlds-largest-online-scams"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The Guardian</a>: May 8, 2024 </h3>
An international investigation revealed a vast network of fake online shops operated from China, duping over 800,000 people in Europe and the US. These fraudulent websites, posing as legitimate retailers of designer brands, collected money and sensitive personal data without delivering any products. The operation involved more than 76,000 fake websites and may have attempted to steal as much as EUR 50 million. The sophisticated network used expired domains to avoid detection, and personal data collected could potentially be exploited for future cybercrimes. This large-scale scam highlighted the growing threat of online fraud and the importance of robust cybersecurity measures. <br/>
<br/>
These six fraud cases from the past six months illustrate the varied and pervasive nature of financial crimes globally. Each case underscores the importance of vigilance, robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation to combat such sophisticated schemes effectively.

71,<h1>Ethics Reporting Hotlines: The Key to Avoiding Financial Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>By: Shannon Walker</p>
<p>Human Resource teams are the gatekeepers of organizations as they are responsible for the vital screening process of every employee. The nature of the job demands the HR team be connected to each employee in some capacity. However, many may not hear from HR until they are involved with wrongdoing – either as a victim, perpetrator or witness.  </p>
<p>
Occupational fraud is just one form of wrongdoing that can plague workplaces and create extensive investigations for human resource departments. However, in many fraud cases, another employee tips HR off internally. Here, the department is also responsible for protecting this reporter's anonymity when possible and ensuring they can return to work without repercussions from management or co-workers. Having a safe, secure and reliable reporting system for employees to use will help ensure that wrongdoing is reported while whistleblowers are protected.  </p>
<h2>The Potential Impact of Fraud  </h2>
<p>
In the fall of 2022, the CBC reported that more than half a million dollars was lost from a Manitoba municipalities bank account. The details of the report state a suspected internal breach through multiple e-transfers led to a significant loss over the course of two years. The duration and corresponding loss for the case in Manitoba is not out of the ordinary. In fact, a typical case of occupational fraud lasts a year before it is detected, and the median loss for cases in 2022 was approximately $117,000.  </p>
<p>Cases of fraud in the workplace can range from activities including check tampering, payroll fraud, vendor fraud, theft and false expense claims, among others. While any of these activities will be a hit on the organization, they can also become a threat or danger to employees who accidentally witness wrongdoing. It is in everyone's best interest that fraud is reported as soon as possible, and HR personnel are responsible for fostering a space that allows employees to speak up.  </p>
<h2>How Internal Reporting Catches Fraud </h2>
In the case of the Manitoba municipality, the immediate process changes made included new limitations on e-transfer authorizations, additional approvals for financial reports and increased frequency of financial audits. What was not included was a way for council members to be able to report suspicious activity without fear of retaliation. This specific matter demonstrates how a majority of occupational fraud goes undetected and becomes more costly as the fraudulent activity persists, in this case, over the course of two years.  <br/>
<h2>Encouraging Internal Reporting </h2>
The fact is, in any industry, employees take notice of wrongdoing around them quicker than managers, executives and HR personnel. It is the nature of a hierarchical organization and how jobs are delegated. However, this is a slippery slope for organizations as many can fall into an “us against them” dynamic where employees are protecting each other, and executives are retaliating against employees. To avoid this, the executive and HR teams must promote and create a space for employees to speak up against wrongdoing. <br/>
<h2>The Role of Anonymity </h2>
A crucial part of enforcing a speak-up culture is the role of anonymity. For employees, this helps to eliminate the fear of being ostracized or punished for coming forward with information that will potentially lead to the reprimanding of another employee. In the past, whistleblowers have had the negative connotation of ‘snitch’ or ‘rat’ attached to their person for going against their peers. However, the information whistleblowers carry is crucial to the organization's health, so they must be supported. Whistleblowers need to be encouraged, protected and certainly acknowledged for their role in serving the organization's and its employees' best interests. This is an integral component of any successful program and a foundational aspect of nurturing a speak-up culture.  <br/>
<br/>
In 2022, 42% of all frauds were detected by tips, and more than half of these tips came from employees. While 70% of victim organizations recorded in the Occupational Fraud Study had hotlines, the fraud losses at organizations without hotlines were two times higher. Implementing an ethics hotline that can bring reports to the HR team efficiently and anonymously will be vital for preventing occupational fraud now and moving forward. <br/>
<h2>Best Practices for Implementing Ethics Hotlines </h2>
<p>When implementing an ethics hotline, you can choose to either operate in-house or outsource the monitoring and auditing to a third-party operator. The size and organizational structure of your company will help determine which option is best for you. Smaller organizations may benefit from the more cost-effective option of operating in-house, while larger organizations may benefit from outsourcing as it is a more scalable solution.  <br/>
<br/>
Either way, there are a few keys to success when implementing an ethics hotline in any organization, big or small. Awareness, accessibility, alternatives and anti-retaliation policies will be crucial for ensuring the effective implementation of an ethics hotline.  <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Awareness </strong>refers to the need for employees to know about the reporting tool and how and when to use it. When introducing a new ethics reporting tool, be sure to have a training seminar with employees and integrate it into the orientation process for new hires. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Accessibility </strong>will be essential for ensuring the reporting tool is used in a timely manner. When employees can access the system from anywhere in the world, any day of the year and preferably speak in their native tongue, they will be more likely to use the service.  <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Alternatives </strong>are often necessary to ensure everyone is comfortable with making a report. While hotlines are the traditional method for reporting, in 2022, email and web tips, both surpassed hotlines as more common methods for reporting. Having an omnichannel system for reporting will further facilitate accessibility and encourage speaking up.  <br/>
<br/>
<strong>An anti-retaliation policy</strong> will give your human resource team the authority to have zero tolerance for those who retaliate against employees for speaking up. Retaliation may come in the form of ostracization, bullying and harassment. This policy should require swift action and have no exemptions, meaning even senior executives will be held accountable if they retaliate against a whistleblower.  </p>
<h2>Addressing Potential Roadblocks </h2>
Misuse through underutilization or overutilization is the most common concern with hotlines. Outlining your policy from the top down and implementing it through ongoing training will be keys to mitigating risks. If your organization struggles with a toxic or “hush” culture were speaking up against wrongdoing is discouraged, you may struggle to transform this into a speak-up culture. As with any new process, implementation takes time, and the associated culture shift may take longer. However, if you stay diligent in enforcing awareness, accessibility, alternatives and anti-retaliation policies, you will start to notice the positive shift.  <br/>

74,<h1>The Value in Establishing Public-Private Partnerships</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>In a recent webinar presented to ACFE Corporate Alliance members and ACFE Law Enforcement and Government Alliance members, Lauren Kohr, Strategic Engagement Advisor of Public/Private Partnerships and Outreach for IRS-Criminal Investigations, and Victor Cardona, CFE, Senior Vice President and BSA Office Head of Anti-Money Laundering for Golden State Bank, delved into the significance of establishing public-private partnerships (PPP). </p>
<h2><span style=""color: windowtext;"">Why Prioritize Public-Private Partnerships?</span></h2>
<p>These partnerships offer trusted points of contact, providing a reliable avenue for collaboration. Additionally, PPPs enable the leveraging of additional resources, enhancing the capacity to combat financial crimes effectively. By facilitating the ability to help “trace fraud,” enabling more timely responses and follow-up actions, PPPs play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of financial systems. Moreover, they foster network linkage and targeting, resulting in investigative efficiencies. Overall, prioritizing PPPs is instrumental in achieving collaborative efforts aimed at safeguarding financial institutions and the community against fraudulent activities. </p>
<p>Partnerships allow for the sharing of targeted information, thereby resulting in a more efficient use of resources. This leads to allowing the private industry to conduct more focused and targeting fraud investigations, assisting to identify fraudulent activity that may not be detectable with automated systems or processes, and financial intelligence and information providing law enforcement with data to initiate or enhance investigations. </p>
<p>Initiatives like Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Cornerstone Program and the El Camino Real Financial Crimes Task Force illustrate the power of collaboration in combating financial crimes. These partnerships bridge the gap between public and private sectors, fostering mutual understanding and cooperation.</p>
<h2><span style=""color: windowtext;"">Framework Considerations for a PPP</span></h2>
<p>Before delving deeper into PPPs, it is essential to recognize that successful partnerships hinge on perspective, adaptability, trust and accountability, all vital components for maintaining the value chain. Understanding several framework considerations is crucial for establishing effective partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Contribute</strong>: Partnerships thrive when both parties contribute resources, expertise, commitment and engage in training and knowledge sharing. </p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: It is important to understand the context behind partnership establishment, encompassing risk and cost sharing along with joint decision-making. </p>
<p><strong>Perspective</strong>: Balancing perspectives from law enforcement and the private sector is critical, ensuring the protection of all stakeholders’ interests. </p>
<p><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong>: Roles and responsibilities must be clearly defined to set expectations, ensure accountability and maintain effective communication. </p>
<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong>: Information sharing acts as a gateway to meaningful and sustainable collaboration. </p>
<p><strong>Innovation</strong>: Innovation drives proactive fraud detection and prevention strategies. </p>
<h2><span style=""color: windowtext;"">Establishing a Framework</span></h2>
<p>The goal is to serve as a continuous feedback loop of information obtained through PPPs, intelligence and information sharing to public and private sector partners and internal section of criminal investigations (CI). </p>
<p>F.I.R.S.T.: <strong>F</strong>eedback <strong>I</strong>n <strong>R</strong>esponse <em>to</em> <strong>S</strong>trategic <strong>T</strong>hreats.</p>
<p><strong>Three-Pronged Approach</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>CI FIRST PPP Initiative: </strong>This initiative focuses on the public-private partnership, emphasizing information sharing with private sector partners. </li>
<li><strong>CI FIRST Feedback Alerts: </strong>This creates a collaborative public-facing document to address emerging trends, typologies, red flags and training needs.</li>
<li><strong>CI FIRST Strategic Engagement and Information Sharing: </strong>This aspect evaluates the effectiveness of outreach efforts and identifies areas where each partner can bring value. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Operationalizing Public-Private Partnerships</strong></p>
<p>Establishing a foundation for effective partnership and expanding the framework for strategic partnerships are pivotal steps in operationalizing PPPs. This requires a phased approach:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Foundation for an effective partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Expanded framework for strategic partnerships – trusted, effective and tactical.</p>
<h2><span style=""color: windowtext;"">Building Effective and Sustainable Partnerships – Where to Start</span></h2>
<p><strong>Industry Trade Groups/Associations</strong>: Industry trade groups and associations, such as the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), provide valuable platforms for engagement, including chapter meetings, peer groups, conferences and centers of influence.</p>
<p><strong>Investing in the Partnership</strong>: This involves building trust, understanding perspectives and making time for meaningful interactions. </p>
<p><strong>Leverage and Expand the Partnership</strong>: Leveraging and expanding the partnership requires assessing opportunities, facilitating information sharing, network building and prioritizing capacity building of individuals, organizations, operations or products involved in the partnership. </p>
<p><strong>Succession/Transition Planning</strong>: This type of planning ensures continuity through smooth communication, identifying replacements and maintaining momentum. </p>
<h2><span style=""color: windowtext;"">Overcoming Challenges in PPPs</span></h2>
<p>Challenges surround PPPs. Time constraints, limited resources, differing perspectives, mismatched priorities, and legislative environment, legal and privacy often hinder the PPP process. Overcoming these obstacles demands open communication, flexibility and a shared commitment to common goals.</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong>: 23% of the people who were polled at the beginning of this webinar said they do not have time. But how can we find time? Is there 15 minutes or half an hour, once a month, to start building that value chain for yourself? Effective time management is crucial for building value and fostering partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Resources</strong>: When challenged with limited resources, how do we best use the resources we do have? Optimizing available resources helps overcome limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Different Perspectives and Mismatched Priorities</strong>: Aligning different perspectives and priorities requires finding common ground for effective collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Legislative Environment, Legal and Privacy</strong>: Navigating legislative and legal challenges necessitates engaging legal experts for guidance. </p>
<p>Even with the challenges they may present, PPPs are indispensable in enhancing collaboration, leveraging resources and combating financial crimes effectively. By overcoming obstacles through open communication and shared commitment, PPPs can yield significant results in safeguarding financial systems. </p>

76,<h1>Navigating Dangerous Waters</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">

                By: Clarisse Persia, CFE
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Since the 15th century, the maritime industry has flourished thanks to the trade of exotic spices and later the slave trade. In the 17th century the establishment of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the world's first multinational corporation, privatized maritime trade, bringing the logic of profit to the seven seas. According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development, in 2023 <a href=""https://unctad.org/meeting/launch-review-maritime-transport-2023"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://unctad.org/meeting/launch-review-maritime-transport-2023"">maritime trade</a> accounted for over 80% of international trade, carried out by vessels flagged and owned by different countries and manned by international crews. The multiple jurisdictions involved and the distance to land contribute to making maritime trade prone to the exploitation of labor, environmental and human rights laws, as we will see shortly. </p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Not All Flags Are Equal </h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Since ancient times, “false flags” were used by traders and pirates to hide a vessel’s intended use or destination. The name, “flag of convenience” can be traced back to the 16th century when English traders illegally used the Spanish flag to circumvent trade restrictions. Today, flying a <a href=""https://www.marinetraffic.com/blog/the-birth-of-the-modern-flag-state/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.marinetraffic.com/blog/the-birth-of-the-modern-flag-state/"">flag of convenience</a> means that the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. Typically, the flag state offers advantages such as fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labor, lower or no registration fees and taxes. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">This <a href=""https://www.economist.com/1843/2016/04/06/panamas-laundry-service"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.economist.com/1843/2016/04/06/panamas-laundry-service"">practice</a> began in the 1920s when U.S. ships registered in Panama to smuggle alcohol during Prohibition. According to Lloyd’s List ranking of largest flag states, in 2023 Liberia became the largest <a href=""https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1147549/Top-10-flag-states-2023"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1147549/Top-10-flag-states-2023"">flag state</a>, followed by Panama. These open registries guarantee anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held accountable. In Europe, the <a href=""https://gvzh.mt/services/practice-areas/shipping/ship-registration-finance/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://gvzh.mt/services/practice-areas/shipping/ship-registration-finance/"">Maltese flag</a> has become the most common flag allowing registration irrespective of nationality, low registration and tonnage tax. </p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">""Part of the Crew, Part of the Ship"" </h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">One of the main benefits of having a flag of convenience is that it allows vessels to circumvent stricter labor laws. A July 2023 guidance by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), a trade union federation, <a href=""https://www.itfglobal.org/sites/default/files/node/resources/files/ITF-HRDD_Guidance.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.itfglobal.org/sites/default/files/node/resources/files/ITF-HRDD_Guidance.pdf"">reported</a> extreme cases concerning seafarer abandonment, abuse and human trafficking in the shipping industry. MSC Cruises was <a href=""https://www.ship2shore.it/it/article/59232"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.ship2shore.it/it/article/59232"">convicted</a> by a Brazilian Labour Court in 2015 for exploiting 11 crew members. In 2012, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/29/cruise-firm-performance-bonuses-tips"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/29/cruise-firm-performance-bonuses-tips"">P&amp;O Cruises</a> hit the headlines over its crew who was paid a basic salary of 75 pence per hour, while in 2023 <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-carnival-uk-nautilus-union-fire-rehire-pay-cut-2023-11?r=US&amp;IR=T"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-carnival-uk-nautilus-union-fire-rehire-pay-cut-2023-11?r=US&amp;IR=T"">Carnival UK</a> was reported to have threatened to fire 919 of its staff if they refused to take pay cuts. </p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Environmental Crimes </h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Two case studies included in a report by ITF Global reveal how flags of convenience are exploited to commit criminal activity. In 2011, Spanish shipowner Antonio Vidal Pego was found guilty in the U.S. for illegally importing toothfish and obstructing justice. His affiliated company <a href=""https://www.itfglobal.org/sites/default/files/resources-files/flag_state_performance.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.itfglobal.org/sites/default/files/resources-files/flag_state_performance.pdf"">Vidal Armadores SA</a> owned or operated five fishing vessels, two of whom were registered to North Korea, after being renamed and reflagged multiple times. <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/observances/end-illegal-fishing-day#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%201,the%20sustainability%20of%20our%20planet"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.un.org/en/observances/end-illegal-fishing-day#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%201,the%20sustainability%20of%20our%20planet"">UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)</a> tons of fish yearly amounting to USD 10–23 billion as of 2016. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">With mounting concerns for environmental pollution, a 2020 <a href=""https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/Fourth-IMO-Greenhouse-Gas-Study-2020.aspx"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/Fourth-IMO-Greenhouse-Gas-Study-2020.aspx"">study</a> by the International Maritime Organization revealed that shipping accounted for 2.89% of global manmade emissions in 2018. A high-profile pollution case involved the Maltese-flagged tanker Erika, which sank off the coast of France pouring 30,000 tons of fuel in 1999. In 2008 a French tribunal ruled against multiple defendants including its owner, Italian financier Giuseppe Savarese, who hid behind a layer of Liberian and Maltese companies. French courts’ efforts to <a href=""https://www.itfglobal.org/sites/default/files/resources-files/flag_state_performance.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.itfglobal.org/sites/default/files/resources-files/flag_state_performance.pdf"">hold the Malta Maritime Authority accountable</a> failed because it is subject only to Maltese laws.  </p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Shadow Fleets and Ghost Ships  </h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">After the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia has relied on a network of companies, based in Dubai and the EU (the Spanish enclave of Ceuta and Greece) <a href=""https://www.corriere.it/esteri/23_maggio_09/cina-dubai-india-l-enorme-flotta-fantasma-che-aiuta-russia-esportare-petrolio-ae3bc82e-ee64-11ed-a775-dde3d50a6495.shtml?refresh_ce"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.corriere.it/esteri/23_maggio_09/cina-dubai-india-l-enorme-flotta-fantasma-che-aiuta-russia-esportare-petrolio-ae3bc82e-ee64-11ed-a775-dde3d50a6495.shtml?refresh_ce"">to transport Russian crude oil</a>.

<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">The 1900 Dutch play <em>Op hoop van zegen </em>is about a <a href=""https://alchetron.com/Op-Hoop-van-Zegen"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://alchetron.com/Op-Hoop-van-Zegen"">Dutch ship owner</a> sending an unsound fishing boat out into a stormy sea, with the deliberate result that it sinks with the owner pocketing the insurance money. Although this is just a play, one of the most clamorous real-life cases involved <em>Achille Lauro, </em>the Italian ship known as the “Queen of the Seas”, that sank near Somalia in 1994 after three fires broke out, of which two were suspicious. For this, there was talk of insurance fraud and a mysterious instigator. Until this day there is <a href=""https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/fiamme-bordo-e-lachille-lauro-sinabissa-largo-somalia-1980432.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/fiamme-bordo-e-lachille-lauro-sinabissa-largo-somalia-1980432.html"">no proof of this</a>. </p>

77,<h1>The FTC's Battle Against Impersonation Fraud in the Digital Age</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Laura Harris,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>The days of the funny prank phone calls are over. Yes, our refrigerators are running. No, we do not need to catch them. Lately, we are more concerned about <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/feds-threaten-kill-phone-company-behind-biden-robocalls-1851230641"">robocalls impersonating</a> President Biden, or other government officials, sowing bad advice and/or attempting to scam any earnest listeners.  <br/>
<br/>
In <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/02/ftc-proposes-new-protections-combat-ai-impersonation-individuals"">February</a>, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated that it is “committed to using all of its tools to detect, deter and halt impersonation fraud” and opened up for commentary on a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPR). The proposed supplements would allow the FTC to more effectively and efficiently right consumers harmed by impersonation schemes and more effectively address the types of unlawful impersonation affecting consumers. Such changes would impact the finalized proposal to change the rules regarding government and business impersonation (entitled the Rule on Impersonation of Government and Businesses or Impersonation Rule). The SNPR <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/r207000_impersonation_snprm.pdf"">proposal </a>seeks to “add a prohibition on the impersonation of individuals and extend liability for violations of the Rule to parties who provide goods and services with knowledge or reason to know that those goods or services will be used in impersonations of the kind that are themselves unlawful under the Rule.”  <br/>
<br/>
This comes at a time when the FTC <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/02/nationwide-fraud-losses-top-10-billion-2023-ftc-steps-efforts-protect-public"">reports </a>fraud losses topping $10 billion in 2023, more than a 14% increase from 2022, and receiving more than 2.6 million fraud reports from consumers. The FTC’s Consumer Sentinel Network, which receives reports directly from consumers, all levels of law enforcement agencies, the Better Business Bureau, industry members and non-profit organizations received 5.4 million reports in 2023. (A full breakdown of reports received in 2023 is available on <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/explore-data"">the FTC’s data analysis site</a>.) <br/>
<br/>
The overwhelming number of complaints begs the attention of the FTC, which promotes a mission to protect the public from deceptive or unfair business practices and from unfair methods of competition through law enforcement, advocacy, research and education. The swiftly developing nature of artificial intelligence (AI) is a concern for consumers and businesses alike, as it is easily manipulated for fraudulent purposes. From deepfakes, voice-cloning, chatbots and mimicked writing styles, AI-supported scams are growing at an exponential rate. <br/>
<br/>
The finalized amendments to the <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/r207000_govt_biz_impersonation_rule.pdf"">Impersonation Rule</a> state: </p>
<ul>
<li>It is a violation of this part, and an unfair or deceptive act or practice to:  <span style=""white-space: pre;""></span>
<ul>
<li>(a) materially and falsely pose as, directly or by implication, a government entity or officer thereof, in or affecting commerce as commerce is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44); or </li>
<li>(b) materially misrepresent, directly or by implication, affiliation with, including endorsement or sponsorship by, a government entity or officer thereof, in or affecting commerce as commerce is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44). </li>
</ul>
    And</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is a violation of this part, and an unfair or deceptive act or practice to:
    <ul>
<li>(a) materially and falsely pose as, directly or by implication, a business or officer thereof, in or affecting commerce as commerce is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44); or  </li>
<li>(b) materially misrepresent, directly or by implication, affiliation with, including endorsement or sponsorship by, a business or officer thereof, in or affecting commerce as commerce is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44). </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the above enables the FTC to directly seek monetary relief in federal court from scammers that: </p>
<ul>
<li>Use government seals or business logos in communications with consumers by mail or online. </li>
<li>Spoof government and business emails and web addresses, including mimicking “.gov” email addresses or using similar email addresses or websites that rely on misspellings of a company’s name. </li>
<li>Falsely imply government or business affiliation by using terms that are known to be affiliated with a government agency or business (e.g., stating “I’m calling from the Clerk’s Office” to falsely imply affiliation with a court of law). </li>
</ul>
<p>However, several comments on the Impersonation Rule addressed the pervasive threat of individual impersonation, which led to the SNPR. The proposed amendment would prohibit not just impersonation of government entities and businesses, but also the impersonation of individuals. Additionally, it establishes third-party liability for companies and developers that know or have reason to know their technology is being used to defraud consumers through impersonation and misuse of their resources. By expanding the Impersonation Rule to include the impersonation of impersonation other than government entities and businesses, the FTC is able to pursue perpetrators of other impersonation schemes, such as romance frauds or grandparent schemes. </p>

78,<h1>Strengthening Preventive Strategies Against Product Diversion in India's Pharma Industry</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Anuj Choudhary,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""margin-bottom: 16px;"">The Indian pharmaceutical sector is increasingly facing a formidable challenge — the diversion of institutional drugs to retail markets. This issue, predominantly orchestrated by sales representatives and stockiest, is eroding market integrity and posing risks to public health and ethics.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Institutional drugs, usually offered at significant discounts to healthcare facilities, are being diverted to retail markets for higher profits. This trend not only incurs financial losses but also contributes to corruption in the retail sector.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">This blog is a follow up to the previous insight published in May 2023 on <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=forensic-approach-reel-off-diversion-institutional-product-local-markets""><em>ACFE Insights</em></a> and focuses on preventive strategies, rather than investigative experiences.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Core Preventive Strategies</h2>
<ol>
<li><span>Robust Stockiest Agreements: Implementing agreements with zero-tolerance policies to discourage diversion is crucial. Regular audits and stringent compliance checks are essential.</span></li>
<li><span>Binding Anti-Diversion Contracts: Contracts that restrict distributors from selling outside assigned channels and assigned areas, backed by severe penalties, are necessary.</span></li>
<li><span>Rotational Policy for Sales Representatives: Rotating representatives across different regions and therapeutic areas can help prevent collusion and fraud.</span></li>
<li><span>Comprehensive Reconciliation Processes: Adopting reconciliation processes akin to GSTR-1 for secondary sales can aid in identifying discrepancies early.</span></li>
<li><span>Data-Driven Approaches: Utilizing analytics to monitor sales patterns and detect anomalies is key.</span></li>
<li><span>Enhanced Due Diligence on Business Partners: Conducting thorough risk assessments on all business partners to identify and mitigate potential diversion risks.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Additional Control Measures</h2>
<ol>
<li><span>Transparent Inventory Management: Implementing real-time inventory tracking systems to prevent unauthorized product movement.</span></li>
<li><span>Training and Awareness Programs: Educating employees about the ethical, legal and business implications of product diversion.</span></li>
<li><span>Whistleblower Policies: Encouraging the reporting of unethical practices with adequate protection and incentives for whistleblowers.</span></li>
<li><span>Collaboration with Regulatory Bodies: Staying updated with regulatory changes and compliance requirements through active collaboration with authorities.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Preventing product diversion requires a holistic approach, combining legal, technological and educational strategies. By adopting these measures, pharmaceutical companies cannot only protect their operations from fraud but also uphold market integrity and public health.</p>

<li>The Profile of a Fraudster: An updated look inside the typical fraudster, including their position within the organization, tenure and the methods they most commonly used to conceal fraud. </li>
<li>Methods of Detection: The 2024 Report to the Nations provides new data on how frauds are being detected, emphasizing the increasing role of technology and data analytics in uncovering fraudulent activities. </li>
<li>Anti-Fraud Controls: An evaluation of the importance of effective anti-fraud controls, with more than half of occupational frauds occurring due to a lack of internal controls or an override of existing internal controls. </li>
</ul>
<h2>A Legacy of Insight and Vigilance </h2>
Since its inception in 1996, the Report to the Nations has served as a beacon of understanding in the murky waters of occupational fraud. With each edition, we build upon the knowledge of the past, striving to unveil the complexities of fraud in the modern age. The journey from the first report to the newest edition underscores a commitment to unveiling truths and bolstering defenses against fraud.

Teams of students, supervised by CFEs and faculty, perform pro bono forensic accounting analyses on cases of alleged financial crimes or occupational fraud, working closely with the alleged victim, law enforcement officials and members of the legal profession. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Our study will help schools mitigate issues with adopting and managing the JFVP to facilitate its continuation and future success, as well as capitalize on the efforts and experiences of schools involved in the JFVP to help future participants in the project. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;""><strong>Glodstein:</strong> There are three possible extensions to our project. The first is based on the current demand for information about the JFVP and the ACFE’s promotion of the project with ACFE Chapters. The audience of our current research is the academic community and a natural extension of the project would be to provide additional best practice guidance to law enforcement, an information booklet about the JFVP and how to manage it for ACFE chapters. A second extension of this project would include the development of a model through which JFVP participants can share resources to improve the likelihood of long-term success. Some of the biggest challenges that exist with schools operating the JFVP are a lack of cases or a lack of students; however, lockdowns showed us how to work more efficiently and effectively as remote employees. Therefore, this project would provide a way for schools to share human capital (I.e., students, faculty, and CFE mentors) and cases across a secure platform similar to the way law enforcement agencies operate.  Finally, a third extension of this project would include longitudinal studies of the student participants and their career paths. We know that many of the students who participate in the JFVP become CFEs and some go on to become chapter leaders, but we have not previously had the resources to track their and ACFE chapter perspectives. </p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">How do you believe your research will contribute to the field of fraud examination and prevention? </h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;""><strong>Rice:</strong> This research project promotes the Justice for Fraud Victims Project, which  increases student interest in the anti-fraud profession and many of the students in the project become CFEs and some have become ACFE Chapter leaders. Our project provides a best practice guide for academics looking to implement the JFVP, which leads to students becoming anti-fraud professionals.  </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;""><strong>Glodstein:</strong> I believe that we can use our research with the JFVP as a mechanism for future fraud fighters to develop their skills to prevent fraud, as well as a research and teaching tool to educate individuals, small businesses and non-profit entities on the risks of fraud. </p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">What are some of the biggest challenges you have faced in your research? </h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;""><strong>Rice:</strong> One of the biggest challenges we faced was collecting data. Our dataset was small, but collecting the data was time-consuming because of our methodology. To collect data, we conducted interviews of academics at each of the schools we were aware of who implemented or are currently running the JFVP. We asked the academics to then forward survey links on to the CFEs, students and members of law enforcement who worked on the JFVP with them. The survey asked respondents to complete open-ended questions, which meant it was also time-consuming for them. We had planned for these challenges, though, and structured our study to analyze the text of the responses we received.  </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;""><strong>Glodstein: </strong>Creating awareness about the JFVP and how students can be a resource in helping victims of fraud. Also, connecting academics with ACFE professionals/investigators to be mentors and a resource for cases to be handled by the students. </p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">What do you believe are the practical implications of your research for fraud examiners? </h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;""><strong>Rice:</strong> Our research directly impacts the anti-fraud profession by helping to both recruit future anti-fraud professionals and a mechanism for current anti-fraud professionals to offer pro-bono services to vulnerable victims. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;""><strong>Glodstein: </strong>The practical implications for the research are the best practice guides that we can provide to create resources for students and victims. We also hope to create awareness about the JFVP so CFE’s can become mentors to the next generation of fraud fighters. </p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">What advice would you give to fraud examiners and researchers interested in applying for an ACFE Research Institute grant? </h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;""><strong>Rice:</strong> The ACFE provided every significant opportunity in my career. Joining as a student member opened my eyes to the anti-fraud profession, provided me the opportunity to grow a strong network locally and globally, and helped me learn from mentors like Joe Dervaes, Bob Holtfreter and Bethmara Kessler.  I had the opportunity to join the Spokane Chapter of the ACFE during its formation early in my career, and I was able to make connections and develop my professional network in a meaningful way. As a chapter leader, I met and worked with anti-fraud professionals from various industries, which led to advancements in my career, opportunities to collaborate with high integrity professionals, and my involvement with the JFVP.   </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">The ACFE also supported my transition to academia through the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship. Leaving practice to become a full-time student was a big shift for me and my family, but thanks to the generous support of the ACFE chapters and donors, I can now inspire future anti-fraud professionals daily.   </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Researchers interested in an ACFE Research Institute grant should learn as much as they can about the anti-fraud profession and read <em>Fraud Magazine</em> and other practitioner journals as part of their literature review to ensure their project is relevant to practitioners and helps the profession. Researchers should also reach out to their local chapter to hear members’ anecdotes and even to seek their advice on the research project before starting. Collaborating with those who do the work will help enhance the relevance and impact of the research. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;""><strong>Glodstein:</strong> The ACFE has provided support, through the ACFE Education Partnership, and resources that we use in our fraud examination and other fraud courses. Also, the ACFE, through its continuing educational resources, keeps CFE’s informed with current events in various types of fraud. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px;"">I would strongly encourage fraud examiners and researchers to present their research to the ARI. The feedback from presenting your research can be extremely helpful in guiding both your current and future research. </p>

84,<h1>Top 5 Fraud Trends of 2024</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Mason Wilder,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Detecting and preventing fraud is a daunting task that requires anti-fraud professionals to regularly adapt to a continuously evolving risk landscape. There are consistent factors in fraud, like social engineering tactics that exploit human behavioral tendencies or external financial pressures that lead fraudsters to commit their crimes, but there are also trends and themes that emerge and affect the anti-fraud profession on a more limited timeframe. </p>
<p>Forecasting is inherently a risky exercise, but based on recent fraud-related news and discussions with subject matter experts over the course of regular ACFE operations, here are five trends that are expected to have a significant impact on the anti-fraud profession in 2024. </p>
<h2>Scams Enhanced by Generative AI</h2>
<p>
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, or deep learning AI models used for high-quality image, video, audio or text generation, became much more mainstream with the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022. The proliferation of easy-to-use generative AI software, such as programs or apps that generate deepfakes, has already been utilized by fraudsters to generate more convincing images, video, audio and text in their scams, but the scale of its weaponization will grow tremendously in 2024, and affect both individuals and organizations. <br/>
One major fraud involving deepfakes of multiple people on a single video call already caused a multinational company in Hong Kong to lose more than $25 million this year, and numerous other examples of scams ranging from virtual kidnappings utilizing voice cloning technology to romance frauds leveraging text generation similar to ChatGPT capabilities have been reported and will only increase.</p>
<p>As the technology gets better, so do the scams using it. Fraud examiners can help protect themselves, their employers or clients, and their communities by raising awareness about these scams, and encouraging everyone to exercise a high level of skepticism with any digital communications, but especially those that involve a request for money. 
</p>
<h2>A Resurgence of Cryptocurrency and Digital Asset Fraud</h2>
<p>
Bitcoin was at its highest price since late 2021. Frauds and scams related to cryptocurrencies, coins, tokens and all the other confusing things under the digital assets umbrella have historically ebbed and flowed along with the prices of popular cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoins. With increased enthusiasm around digital assets and more mainstream adoption, fraudsters will follow.</p>
<p>Expect an increase in SIM swaps, digital wallet account takeovers, ransomware, investment scams, hacks or exploitation of decentralized finance (DeFi) companies, and any other fraud schemes either targeting or involving digital assets.
The irreversibility and pseudonymity of digital asset transactions makes them inherently riskier, even when they are not extra attractive to fraudsters due to crypto prices, so consumers should stay diligent about not reusing their passwords for digital wallets, considering multifactor authentication protocols that do not rely on SMS, and being wary of any cannot-miss investment opportunities framing themselves as related to recently approved Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Sending fiat currency instead of cryptocurrency for a transaction will likely have more recourse available in the event of a fraud.
Meanwhile, fraud examiners at organizations that deal in digital assets or possess them should assess existing anti-fraud controls and look for opportunities to improve them.
</p>
<h2>Fraud Involving AI Service Providers</h2>
<p>When a technology hype cycle kicks off, there is never a shortage of companies looking to cash in on the craze or investors looking to identify the next “unicorn” or spread investments across the sector to hedge their bets. This can create a lot of pressure for emerging technology-focused companies to perform, or at least maintain the appearance of performance to reassure existing investors and attract new ones, such as Theranos, Wirecard, Nikola and FTX. </p>
<p>
With more than $150 billion reportedly invested in AI startups since the beginning of 2021, the same kinds of financial pressures that led leaders of the previously mentioned companies to fabricate results or employ creative (fraudulent) accounting practices are in place for the AI sector. This might play out as a singular, major fraud scandal affecting a major player in the sector, with the direct impact mostly limited to the company’s investors and creditors. Alternatively, it could play out in the failure of multiple start-ups on a smaller scale. Either outcome would likely shake public faith in the sector and in turn affect the trajectory of the technology’s adoption and the viability of AI companies doing things by the book. </p>
<p>Fraud examiners tasked with due diligence or auditing engagements concerning AI service providers should keep these factors in mind and perhaps apply a little more scrutiny to make sure that they do not overlook any red flags. </p>
<h2>Increased Obligations and/or Liabilities for Preventing and Detecting Fraud </h2>
<p>The passage, or royal assent, of the United Kingdom Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill in late 2023 establishes a new failure to prevent offence [sic] for organizations that profit from fraud committed by their employees, even if they were unaware of the fraud while it was occurring. Since new laws and/or regulations that emerge from Europe often end up producing copycat responses from other regions, anti-fraud programs could be tasked with preventing yet another fraud-related liability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) recently proposed a change to its standards for auditors that would increase the responsibilities to detect fraud in a client’s financial statements. This came months after the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) made a similar proposal to update its standards related to auditors’ responsibilities to detect fraud. Although neither proposal has yet been adopted and reflected in updates to the standards, it could happen in 2024 and would have a significant impact on auditors and ultimately strengthen the anti-fraud profession, assuming auditors embrace the upgraded fraud detection responsibilities.</p>
<h2>Continued COVID Fraud Enforcement in the U.S.</h2>
<p>
In 2022, the United States passed legislation that extended the statute of limitations for fraud related to several federal benefit programs from five years to 10, meaning that federal law enforcement in the U.S. will not have to be as selective with investigation, enforcement and prosecution of these fraud cases.
Many fraudsters who carried out COVID benefit fraud have yet to face any consequences from their schemes, simply because the resources required to work through the caseload have exceeded what the federal government has been able to allocate. As these fraudsters have been out there living their best lives, it is reasonable to suspect they have been looking for other fraud schemes to carry out, since most fraudsters do not decide to quit committing fraud when they believe they have gotten away with it.</p>
<p>However, there are a great many federal law enforcement agents working dutifully to investigate these cases, so many fraudsters will be getting very unwelcome knocks on their doors in 2024 that could ultimately provide investigative leads for other frauds they have committed. These investigations and prosecutions will also likely provide incredibly valuable blueprints for future fraud investigations as law enforcement agents develop and hone new techniques to uncover and prove fraud, trace assets and recover funds.<br/>
Time will tell how accurate or relevant these trends end up being this year, but hopefully these valuable insights can be extracted to aid in the prevention, detection or investigation of fraud in 2024 and beyond.</p>

86,<h1>Delivered Wrongful Convictions: The U.K. Postal Scandal</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In one of the most significant miscarriages of justice in the history of the United Kingdom, more than 900 post office branch managers were wrongly accused of theft or fraud due to a flawed computer system called Horizon. This scandal, which unfolded between 1999 and 2015, has had profound consequences, including imprisonment, financial ruin and other tragic outcomes. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Investigation</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The unraveling of the U.K. Post Office scandal and the subsequent investigation into wrongful convictions emerged from a series of revelations that exposed the Post Office’s aggressive tactics to secure convictions against the sub-postmasters. Stephen Bradshaw admitted to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/11/i-am-not-a-mafia-gangster-post-office-investigator-tells-horizon-inquiry"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">offering lenient charges</span></a> in exchange for the accused’s silence regarding the flaws in the Horizon information technology (IT) system. In addition, Edward Henry KC, who represents some of the falsely accused victims, stated that there was evidence that the Horizon IT system was not working from the very beginning. These revelations, laid bare during a public inquiry, shed light on a systemic failure within the Post Office’s investigative processes.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Courts</strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The courts have taken a proactive role in reassessing the evidence to ensure that innocent sub-postmasters are exonerated. They are meticulously reviewing case files, analyzing testimonies and assessing financial records. In doing so, the courts aim to identify inaccuracies and discrepancies in accounting systems and point to systemic failures rather than individual wrongdoing. So far, out of the 900 sub-postmasters wrongfully convicted, the court of appeal has overturned 95 of those cases, one of which was Kathleen Crane. The former post office branch operator was cleared of all charges after <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/25/horizon-scandal-post-office-operator-kathleen-crane-cleared-conviction-quashed"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">three appeal court judges ruled</span></a> that Crane’s conviction was “unsafe” and that she was “kept in ignorance” of Horizon’s defects. Kathleen Crane is the first of hundreds of branch owner-operators expected to reach the court of appeal as a result of the Post Office case review. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-quash-wrongful-post-office-convictions"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">acknowledged</span></a> the severity of the situation, labeling it “one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in the nation's history.” He has pledged to introduce measures, including a new law, to swiftly overturn all convictions and compensate those wrongly accused. Though the new legislation is not yet published, the U.K. Prime Minister says victims would be eligible for an <a href=""https://time.com/6552764/uk-post-office-scandal-police-investigate-potential-fraud/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">upfront payment</span></a> of EUR 75,000. Sunak stated, “We must do everything we can to exonerate and compensate these innocent people, and make sure they finally get the justice they deserve.” </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Parliamentary Committee</strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A parliamentary committee has launched its own <a href=""https://committees.parliament.uk/work/97/post-office-and-horizon/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">inquiry</span></a>, recognizing the urgency for a comprehensive investigation. This committee is scrutinizing the mechanisms that led to these convictions, questioning the oversight of the postal system's financial processes. The collaborative effort between the judiciary and parliament signals a united commitment to addressing the errors made against the sub-postmasters and rectifying systemic issues. Most recently, the Commons’ Business and Trade Committee has been working out a way to <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/britain-post-office-scandal-conviction-exoneration-2fa70dd0c0b5ac1850e031e5534f7392"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">speed up compensation</span></a> for the victims.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As the U.K. grapples with this grave injustice, there is a collective push for accountability, compensation and reforms to prevent similar instances of judicial error in the future. The collaboration between the courts, parliament and advocacy groups underscores the urgency and commitment to rectifying the systemic failures that have marred the U.K. postal system. Going forward, the nation anticipates legislative changes, compensation for victims and an overhaul of the postal system to restore public trust. </p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Being a fraud examiner takes many forms in different ways, across various industries. Being a forensic accountant usually requires a CPA license at a minimum, or if you’re working on federal taxes, you need to be an enrolled agent. But there are many ways to get into the game—take advantage of all the options and explore what is out there.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In public service, for example, there are dozens of titles and roles which utilize the fraud examination methodology, but very few roles in the federal government use the title of “fraud examiner.” This video explains what types of jobs in government involved fraud investigation.   </p>

<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Stay positive about the future </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We live in an “on-demand” world and that translates to constantly wanting everything quickly. Unfortunately, job searches don’t work that way. Hiring managers are told to “hire slowly,” to ensure the right fit for the job. It is also partially a “numbers game,” where you are competing with hundreds—even thousands—of other applicants with varying qualifications. It is important to be known among your peers (and hiring managers) as a smart, qualified, well-rounded communicator and analyst. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If you stay positive and use the growth mindset, you will recognize that it is about the journey, not a specific destination. <a href=""https://www.macslist.org/career-happiness/seven-resilience-tips-long-term-job-search"">This article</a> also details some excellent advice on being purposeful and resilient in your job search. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Be passionate about anti-fraud </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Albert Einstein once said that he didn’t have any special gifts or talents but was rather “passionately curious.” More recently, Oprah Winfrey said ""Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you."" Be passionate and curious about the work of fraud examination. Seek to learn as much as you can through a variety of ways. Apply your knowledge in everyday situations to practice; then reflect on what you have learned and what you can do differently. Be intentional about the organizations and positions that you apply to and make lasting connections to help people know who you are and why you are passionate about the work of fraud prevention, detection and investigation. Finally, help others once you attain your job—give back to our community and support others as an ACFE mentor.  </p>

88,<h1>Fraud in Retail Settings: Gift Cards and Returns Schemes</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Emily Homer,  PhD</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p><span>As I was waiting for a friend at a retail store during the recent holiday season, I overheard a front-end manager talking with a security officer. The manager described that another employee had noticed some suspicious behavior: customers of the store brought a small scale from home and were seen weighing gift cards using the scale. The pair discussed why the customers would have been weighing gift cards, with the manager suggesting that it may be to determine how much it would cost to mail the gift cards. As she departed, she said to the security officer, “Or it could be some sort of fraud.” </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>I smiled at the mention of fraud, which the security officer noticed. We got into a brief discussion of how fraud can be committed in retail stores. The officer described a gift card scam her store had uncovered: scammers removed the silver strip over a gift card’s PIN, noted the card number and PIN, and replaced the silver strip. They were then able to track the gift card’s usage. Once the gift card was purchased, the scammers were able to steal the funds, victimizing both the store and the unsuspecting customer who bought the compromised gift card. The security officer’s description is a variation of gift card draining.  </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>While it may seem like a lower-level scam, gift card fraud has real consequences for retailers. An analysis of data drawn from the Federal Trade Commission’s Consumer Sentinel database found that gift card scams have led to a consumer loss of $148 million. Both the Federal Trade Commission and the 2023 National Retail Security Survey have reported increases in gift card scams in recent years. More specifically, 57% of the 177 retail brands responding to the National Retail Security Survey reported an increase in gift card scams from 2022 to 2023. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>A second scam common in retail settings is the return scheme. These schemes involve fraudulently victimizing a retailer during the process of completing a consumer return and refund. One study by Riskified identified many common return schemes on a scale of “friendly fraud” to serial abusers and professional fraudsters. These schemes included coupon abuse, false damage claims, item-not-received scams, authorized reseller abuse, empty box returns, photoshopped return labels and, most severely, fraudsters using the dark web to exploit returns policies.  </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The National Retail Federation contributed additional return schemes, including the return of shoplifted/stolen merchandise and returns using counterfeit receipts. Consumers will also return items after using or wearing them, intending to informally ‘rent’ the items as opposed to purchasing them (a practice sometimes referred to as wardrobing). In their “2023 Consumer Returns in the Retail Industry” report, the National Retail Federation reported that its survey respondents reported $101 billion loss to returns abuse and fraud. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Regardless of its form, retail fraud is a concern for many retailers and a reality of doing business. In the study by Riskified of more than 300 merchants, nine out of ten reported experiencing significant costs from multiple fraud and abuse schemes. However, there are ways that merchants can attempt to combat losses to scams including gift card and return schemes. Some suggestions include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span>Review returns and refund policies for loopholes. Consider eliminating cash refunds for purchases not made in cash, implementing a time frame for allowable returns, offering store credit instead of a cash refund and requiring receipts when making a return. </span></li>
<li><span></span><span>Make quantitative data available regarding customers’ purchase and returns history. Review the data for abnormalities.  </span></li>
<li><span></span><span>Require returns to be made in-person so an employee can physically verify the item’s condition and determine the authenticity of the sale and receipt. </span></li>
<li><span></span><span>Keep gift cards close to the registers or behind them to increase the risk of detection for scammers attempting to tamper with gift cards. </span></li>
<li><span></span><span>For online retailers, give detailed and accurate item descriptions so the customer has a greater likelihood of getting what they want without the need to return. Offer ways for customers to virtually see the items on themselves or in their homes before purchasing. </span></li>
<li><span></span><span>Consider automating processes to identify transactions that require further investigation. Riskified suggests that, where possible, companies use automated processes to identify customers who return large numbers of purchases and review item-not-received claims to identify those that might not be authentic. These processes can help detect fraud and determine if specific individuals’ purchasing ability should be restricted.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span></span><span>Rates of retail scams often rise at specific times and under specific conditions. The study from Riskified found that 70% of merchants reported an increase in abuse during the summer shopping season and 67% reported an increase during the post-holiday season. Rates of retail fraud and abuse also increase with rising inflation. However, combatting these forms of retail fraud should be a concern for companies regardless of the time of year or circumstance. </span></p>

<p class="""" style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>One important distinction of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) from other associations is the diversity of our professional base.</strong> Most members of accounting organizations, of course, are accountants. Internal auditors have a group dedicated just to them. Bar associations are comprised of attorneys.

We work in dozens of different professions, including accounting, consulting, law enforcement, cybersecurity, and banking and law, to name a few.

They couldn’t afford college, so they both started working for the largest employer in the area — a paper mill, where they earned a living for over 40 years before retiring.

How dare someone try to “skip the line” and get the rewards without doing the work to get them! That makes me mad. Talking with members, I hear that sentiment echoed.</p><p class="""" style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A good fraud examiner is someone who believes it’s wrong to ignore the rules and steal. Nor is it right when someone enriches themself at the expense of other employees who are following the rules and thinking of others.

92,<h1>The Dichotomy of Modern Government Fraud Schemes and Government Oversight’s Contrasting Approach</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Erik Halvorson</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While reading a recent Bloomberg article about deepfake imposter scams and new fraud trends, I was struck immediately by their <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepfake-imposter-scams-driving-wave-230008332.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAI2WoAJUi1xulmKwf-TCy7srG3nfjNAorBhlhNKCEVIHzXdh2xIIE4zXAW1e6kYyk5id7rLkuzveKGg8qw85EaQR3U-A4VdDn5dVHTT2HDKXfKQ6RgIAGfrJq9T8-qP05uqJIFj7zgK8i4LCIE17yd5SwJeLXVU9xS6NSNPSB7v-"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">graphic</span></a>. There appeared to be an overwhelmingly substantial number of “high loss” fraud schemes being perpetrated in 2022 (as reported by the Federal Trade Commission). This was shocking as it appeared to show more high loss cases than low loss cases. This would signal a marked departure from decades of historical statistics. Statistics we, in program oversight, rely upon to strategize our anti-fraud endeavors.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Upon first glance, I felt a sense of righteous vindication as I have been shouting about the increased risk of sophisticated, high dollar loss schemes for years. Risk to the types of government programs that we see far too often splashed across the headlines of the news. The type of programs funded by massive budgets, guided by program managers who just review self-certifications; programs with funds spread out across multiple federal or state agencies, and overseen by contract or grant administrators trying to review hundreds of awards at a time. In fact, my fear over the last few years has changed. It is no longer the company that gets awarded a few grants or contracts and underperforms on them or fibs on an hourly timecard. My fear, and what keeps me up at night, has turned to stare down a massive tidal wave of domestic organized crime groups, international state sponsored groups, coordinated Fraud-as-a-Service (FaaS) groups, and creative hackers across the globe with technical prowess and seemingly unlimited energy. All these groups share one common goal: the constant targeting of slow-moving and poorly defended government programs. These same government programs run by bureaucrats who fear if they slow the release of funds, even a little, to put controls in place they will be lambasted by their department or in the media.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Then I looked deeper into the chart and was offended as both a researcher and investigator. I realized first this is a terribly misleading graphic and second that even though I dislike the graphic the underlying premise of the article holds true. So, let us talk (briefly) about the graphic first, then explore the underlying message. You will notice a small footnote on the graphic that there were approximately 360,000 fraud reports of $1,000 or less. Combining the foot note with the strange Y-Axis groupings we see objectively there are significantly more small cases than large. Thus, bringing order back to our expectations of fraud case loss sizes and the volume of fraud we experience in government oversight.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Setting the graphic off to the side, let us talk about the underlying premise of the article. There is absolutely a new wave of fraud that is being perpetuated by new technology. Deepfakes are a part of those new fraud schemes, as the articles describe. Another fraud area on the rise is the use of generative AI Large Language Models (LLMs) and the use of “AI technology” to boost schemes by bad actors. AI Large Language Models are programs like ChatGPT. Technology boosts are technological enhancers like AI generated photos, voice simulators, phone number spoofers or AI coding systems that will write a malicious code for you. Both AI technology and technology boosts serve to bridge the gap for less technologically savvy bad actors who want to increase the complexity and sophistication of their fraud across their area of attack. One of the more interesting cases to emerge recently is dubbed <a href=""https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/08/19/meet-fraudgpt-the-dark-side-twin-of-chatgpt/"">FraudGPT</a>. This program reportedly automates different phishing schemes and helps coach would-be fraudsters with suggestions on where to place malicious links. It also contains information on what the most frequently exploited online resources are and can even generate harmful code for its customers.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The rise of a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) program without ethical constraints, used to support fraud, is fairly predictable. But, this GPT program has a surprising difference, the way this GPT service (purchasable through the dark web or via telegram’s messaging secure instant messaging groups) is marketed. FraudGPT has a monthly subscription fee. That is right, not even criminals can get away from the modern era of micro-billing services. Reportedly, the cost to use FraudGPT is $200 per month or $1,700 per year; which admittedly does provide a healthy 29% discount for annual membership. Despite being impressed by the discount, a subscription fee-based model is a business practice I did not think I would ever see in fraud. A practice that seems to demonstrate the organization and quasi-legitimacy of modern fraudsters. Because in the past can any of us see anyone linking their payment information to a service designed to break the law? That seems like one good cyber-based law enforcement operation away from unmasking a ton of bad actors.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Thinking about this situation objectively brings me back to sitting on a panel at <a href=""https://www.auditconsultingeducation.com/fraudretreat/"">Denver’s annual fraud retreat</a>. During a panel I was asked how we should think about AI as it revolutionizes the world around us, and specifically in the area of fraud and anti-fraud mitigation. In my opinion, as oversight professionals, we need to expect to see two things. The first is that with AI boosting technological proficiencies we will see more fraud generally, both in increased sophistication and by volume of cases. The truth is technology has made fraud easier. We need to do everything we can to prepare for this. The next is that while the area of technological fraud grows (and government slowly incorporates technological countermeasures and proactive analytics units) we will also see a rise in unsophisticated traditional fraud schemes. If you follow any of the financial crimes groups you will see that check fraud, for instance, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/your-money/check-fraud-protection.html"">almost doubled between 2021 and 2022</a> (up to ~680,000 instances in 2022) and will cost consumers a staggering <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/on-your-side-check-fraud-is-on-the-rise-heres-how-to-protect-your-money/"">$24B in 2023</a>.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Technology has created a very strange dichotomy in our everyday world and fraud is a microcosm of that world. On the one hand, we have some of the most sophisticated technological fraud schemes ever now being attempted more often and by a broader swath of bad actors. On the other hand, as our focus, manpower and resources, move to combat technology enhanced schemes we leave a blind spot for unsophisticated schemes to thrive in. This idea about voluminous unsophisticated schemes thriving is supported by the footnote found on the initial chart we looked at. At a ratio of 2.2:1, schemes of $1,000 or less are outpacing all other fraud scheme loss amounts. If we look at scams which stole $10,000 or less on our initial chart, we see more than 523,000 cases (a ratio of more than 6:1 in favor of smaller schemes). While at the same time, year over year, we see a baffling continuous growth in larger, more sophisticated fraud schemes as well. Forcing us (in many cases) to either ignore one of the two types of fraud schemes or at best split our focus, funding and manpower. And in large government programs mired by years of “more with less” and “get the money out ASAP; we will chase the fraud later” this is a recipe for disaster. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Ultimately as fraud fighters trying to combat a rising tide of fraud of all levels of complexity, we need to be more flexible and dynamic. To do this we should leverage new technology and fraud analytics techniques by implementing tools being developed by private and commercial software companies. We should understand that social science research has progressed in areas of psychology, criminology, sociology and machine learning/AI that support our effort to identify fraud schemes earlier. This will give our controls a competitive advantage in identifying fraud and keeping losses low.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We also need to invest time and money into growing our people skills. As a special agent of 13 years, I have witnessed a steep decline in our ability to manage human assets, especially post-pandemic. We need to hone interview skills. We need to understand how to build (and maintain) long term strategic relationships with individuals outside our oversight field. And, even with the growth in technology we should remember our best assets are still our people. Especially supporting those that still possess their creative problem solving and optimism in the face of an increasingly difficult bureaucratic system to work and thrive in.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fusing the human element with technological and research-based advancements might just give us the boost we need to combat these schemes. And while I cannot say for sure it will work, I can say for sure that if we fail to innovate and implement agile oversight we will fail. And failing means we continue to see headlines about losing billions of dollars in federal funds to fraud — headlines that will continue to erode public trust in our ability and the necessity of our work. </p>

Only 2.7 million (6.5%) of the 41.1 million persons who need treatment for substance use disorders (SUD) during the course of the previous year received it at a specialty treatment center, according to the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (National Survey on drug abuse and health, 2020). Help is needed for vulnerable individuals to treat their substance dependence, yet many of them receive little to no assistance because of fraud, waste and abuse schemes. Zachary A. Cunha, the defendants' attorney, stated, ""What makes the fraud scheme that we have charged today particularly pernicious is that it was not only, as we allege, designed to defraud by enriching these defendants with federal and private healthcare dollars they did not earn,"" but it also </span><a data-feathr-click-track=""true"" data-feathr-link-aids=""5c3caec2bc2ccd397b6940c2"" href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao-ri/pr/operators-addiction-treatment-chain-charged-alleged-health-care-fraud"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" style=""text-align: justify; color: #1f8cb7;"" target=""_blank"">defrauded a vulnerable population</a><span style=""text-align: justify; color: #000000;""> of recovery patients of the full, genuine support and treatment that they need to have. </span></p>

Taking advantage of the growth in opioid addiction, these profit-seekers have accepted patients from all around the country. For Peter San Angelo, who had been using heroin for ten years and was homeless, the promise of free insurance and lavish rehab in a faraway state turned out to be a lifeline. Using a fictitious address, a patient broker registered the Massachusetts man in a Pennsylvania Blue Cross plan and bought him an airline ticket to Florida. They even made a money-saving offer to purchase him cigarettes. Three months after the 33-year-old drug overdosed, he passed away. </span></p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""></span><span style=""text-align: justify; color: #000000;"">One of the earliest healthcare fraud tactics is upcoding. In the addiction treatment sector, upcoding refers to doctors charging for higher level visits than actually completed (typically in an effort to receive higher reimbursements). For example, a doctor has up coded the service if they charge an addiction patient the maximum evaluation and management CPT 99215 (40+ minutes) for a visit that only took 25 minutes. CPT 99214 is the right code that the doctor ought to have used.

According to the documents included in the press release, Brier, Bruining and RCCA operated a chain of addiction treatment centers but failed to provide patients with the required therapy and counselling sessions. In addition, they commonly submitted claims for 45-minute counselling sessions to Medicare, Medicaid and other health care payers, even though the sessions typically lasted 10 minutes or less. There have been times when the available therapist could not have finished the total quantity of treatment sessions in a 24-hour period due to the volume of sessions being billed at this rate.</span></p>

Patients occasionally receive more prescriptions for medications than they need. This results in patients selling or giving their medications to family and friends. These medications are usually paid for through federal and state insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Obtaining patients from patient recruiters is another aspect of patient brokerage for doctors. In exchange for patients, this typically entails the doctor paying the recruiter gifts and incentives, or ""kickbacks."" A South Florida clinic convicted in a $112 million addiction treatment fraud scheme was highlighted by the USDOJ in 2022.

Because Blue Cross Blue Shield plans have generous benefits and few restrictions on using out-of-network treatment programs for medical care, they often target specific plans.</span></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-align: justify; color: #000000;""></span><span style=""text-align: justify; color: #000000;"">In the addiction treatment sector, invoicing for services not provided and performing unnecessary procedures for addicted individuals is another FWA scheme. To assist addicts in regaining sobriety, sober living homes are registering residents, but in the absence of stringent policies such as federal and state oversight agencies keeping an eye on and requiring proof of recovery from sober living homes, these patients might remain in the sober living homes as long as they can continue to bill federal and state insurance programs for profits at the expense of providing patients with high-quality care. The public was alerted to fraud schemes targeting Native Americans in May 2023 by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General.

94,<h1>HOA Fraud is a Hardly Detected and Thriving Cancer of Our Society</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>By: Olga Zlatkova-Georgiev </p>
<p>For most people, one of the main goals in life is buying your own home. It is rewarding when effort goes into career growth, diligent savings routines and work-life balance sacrifice, for this single goal of purchasing your first home.  The most affordable homes can be the ones built as part of a homeowner’s association (HOA) – nothing wrong with that. The surroundings are always maintained through the HOA and the only thing homeowners need to worry about is the interior of the house, as well as paying regular monthly dues to the HOA.  But after settling in, it may quickly become apparent that living under an HOA involves a level of oversight that can be surprising. </p>
<p>Some examples of this are: </p>
<ul>
<li>After moving in the warm weather came and an umbrella needed to be installed on the patio. Immediately after my umbrella installation, a letter was received stating that it is a “violation” letter due to the color of the umbrella being blue. </li>
<li>I purchased a potted flower and placed it under my kitchen window. The next day, a note was placed on my porch. It was a letter from the cleaning lady, who is also a renter from this complex. The letter is two pages long, handwritten and explains in detail how to take care of the flower.  </li>
<li>A few months later, the same lady knocked on my door to give me a brand-new harness for my dog, along with a business card from a dog trainer because she had seen how much my dog was pulling on the leash during walks.</li>
<li>Another few months go by, when my investigating intuition kicked in, it was discovered that this same person is the HOA’s “spy,” with access to cameras and was being paid by the management company to clean the laundry rooms and the mailrooms for the complex.  </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, during board meetings, it was discovered that the board consists of people who do not know what their position is and are being appointed through acclamation, term after term. Soon after it came to light that the management company had been managing the place for 16 years, with no questions about the financial transactions ever, as well how contractors are being chosen, how much money is being spent out of the reserves account of the HOA and for what purpose. Hey, how about asking for the financial statements – something that is normal to ask for?</p>
<p>When I asked for the financial statements of the HOA, the manager’s response was: “The board has advised that your request needs to be reviewed by the HOA’s attorney.” What? It is the most common knowledge related to the HOA laws and rules, that it is the homeowners’ right to review financial statements. Does this sound like a red flag? So, what is inside the financial statements?</p>
<p>Gift card purchases for large dollar amounts with no explanation, returned fines to the owner who appears to be friends with the board member, board member’s home renovation that included upgrades. The most interesting was the comparative analysis of the year-to-year balances of the reserves account: emptied throughout the fiscal year and then re-funded again with the new budget and increase of monthly dues every fiscal year.  </p>
<p>One gentleman who had lived in this same HOA for 30 years, remembered seeing the management company’s owner the first day they took over this property, shredding the HOA’s documents.  </p>
<p>The homeowners gathered to put our minds together about how to make changes. The main step was changing the board and the management company.</p>
<p>I started doing my homework and researching this particular company and the laws on how to change the board. My research began with searching for “HOA problems” on the web and about HOA problems known to other ACFE members and fraud investigation professionals. The discovery was mind-blowing. When connecting with people who had been experiencing mismanagement by the same property management company, we found a few commonalities with them. These other associations’ reserve accounts were in the red and with an elevated risk for special assessment. For example, it appeared that a lot of people, including members of the ACFE – were affected by fraud within their HOAs at some point in their lives. I started talking to HOA attorneys and one of them said to me after hearing my story that “your community is lucky to have you.”</p>
<p>Together with other like-minded neighbors we called for a special meeting by the members, as per the rules. Immediately, we received sabotage from the operating board and the management company. Their HOA lawyer served their private interest and not the interest of the community. Long story short, they did not recognize the special meeting as being legal and respectively never showed up.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, our community was able to collect more than 50% of members’ votes for board removal. We collectively hired a lawyer who recommended collecting signatures for a petition, in addition to the votes, to make the case stronger. One day, when collecting signatures, I was sending messages to my neighbors explaining to them what the lawyer’s recommendation was. In my messages, I used the expression “this would be a cherry on top.”  A few hours later, one of the board members blasted a mass text message to 164 people, by using a VoIP phone, saying, “Do not sign anything and Olga’s cherry is rotten.”</p>
<p>As you can see, harassment during investigating HOA fraud is quite common. When speaking to a lady from the ACFE Community, for example, I learned how a drone had been sent to spy on her right at her window. I have heard a lot of insane stories along the way of my HOA fraud journey.  <br/>
The main conclusion that was made from all of it was: HOA fraud is not controllable most of the time, due to weak jurisdiction. It is a hardly detected and thriving cancer of our society.<br/>

95,<h1>Emerging Trends in Fraud Law: What Professionals Need to Know</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Stephanie Gordon </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the ever-evolving landscape of fraud, staying informed about emerging trends is not just a choice — it is a necessity. As professionals in the field of fraud prevention, we understand that knowledge is our most potent weapon against the ever-adaptive tactics of fraudsters. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In this blog, we will delve into these trends and explore how to prevent fraud schemes, scams and social engineering exploits. We will also shed light on how machine learning and real-time verification can be leveraged to protect against phishing and the automation of financial crimes. Let us explore this topic to equip ourselves with the knowledge to combat emerging fraud. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Current Trends in Fraud Law: A Brief Overview </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud is a serious and costly problem that affects individuals, businesses and financial institutions. Fraud involves the intentional use of deception or misrepresentation to obtain an unfair or unlawful advantage. In the digital age, fraudsters have more ways to exploit vulnerabilities and defraud unsuspecting victims. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), the median loss caused by fraud is a staggering $3.6 million. Account takeover fraud, the fastest-growing type of fraud, witnessed a 74% increase in losses in 2021. Synthetic identity fraud, a growing concern, accounted for $24 billion in losses in 2020. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It not only highlights the importance of robust internal controls and <a href=""https://www.azcriminallawteam.com/areas-of-practice/fraud/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">expert fraud lawyers</span></a> but also emphasizes the need for financial institutions to implement AI and machine learning, along with multiple detection methods. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud Trends to Watch Out for in 2024 </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The world of fraud is constantly evolving, with new scams and schemes emerging all the time. This means that fraud law professionals need to stay up-to-date on the latest trends in order to effectively represent their clients. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Here are some of the emerging trends in fraud law that professionals need to know about: </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Synthetic identity theft:</strong> Synthetic identity theft is a type of fraud in which criminals create new identities by piecing together elements of a person's personal information, such as name, date of birth and Social Security number, and combining them with false identifiers. Synthetic identities can then be used to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards and commit other types of fraud. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Deepfakes:</strong> Deepfakes are videos or audio recordings that have been manipulated to make it appear as if someone is saying or doing something they never actually said or did. Deepfakes can be used to commit fraud in a variety of ways, such as impersonating a celebrity to endorse a product or service or creating fake videos of someone committing a crime. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Account takeover fraud:</strong> Account takeover fraud occurs when a criminal gains access to a victim's online account, such as a social media account, email account or bank account. Once the criminal has access to the account, they can use it to steal money, commit identity theft or spread malware. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Cryptocurrency scams:</strong> Cryptocurrency scams are on the rise as more and more people invest in cryptocurrencies. These scams can take many different forms, such as fake cryptocurrency exchanges, investment scams and phishing emails. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Insider threats:</strong> Insider threats are fraud schemes that are committed by employees or other individuals who have access to privileged information. Insider threats can be very difficult to detect and prevent, and they can cause significant damage to businesses and organizations. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud law professionals who are aware of these emerging trends will be better equipped to represent their clients and protect them from fraud. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Growing Need for Multi-Layered Fraud Prevention </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the relentless battle against fraud, traditional prevention methods often fall short in addressing the ever-evolving tactics of fraudsters. The surge in fraud cases, including the prevalent takeover through sim swap fraud, underlines the urgency to innovate. A single layer of defense is no longer sufficient. To tackle the escalating fraud risk, it iss imperative to adopt a multi-layered approach. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By integrating various fraud prevention and detection techniques, financial institutions can effectively reduce risk and protect themselves and their customers from potential financial losses. This approach equips professionals to stay ahead in the fight against fraud, employing a robust security framework that leaves no room for fraudsters to exploit vulnerabilities. Stay informed, adapt and use more than one strategy to fortify your defenses and mitigate the impact of fraud. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How AI and Real-Time Analytics Can Enhance Fraud Detection </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">One of the pivotal tools in the battle against fraud is artificial intelligence (AI), which is adept at automating the scrutiny of extensive data and identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent activity. This innovative technology significantly contributes to risk assessment, helping financial institutions stay ahead of evolving fraud. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Furthermore, AI is instrumental in reducing fraud losses by expediting and refining fraud response and mitigation. When integrated with real-time analytics, it allows financial institutions to monitor transactions and customer behavior promptly, promptly flagging potential fraud incidents before they impact critical financial operations. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Here are some specific things that fraud law professionals can do to stay up-to-date on the latest trends: </p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Read industry publications and blogs:</strong> There are a number of industry publications and blogs that focus on fraud and fraud prevention. Reading these publications can help fraud law professionals stay informed about the latest trends and developments in the field.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Attend industry conferences:</strong> There are also a number of industry conferences that focus on fraud and fraud prevention. These conferences can be a great way for fraud law professionals to learn about the latest trends and developments in the field and to network with other professionals in the field.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Take continuing education courses:</strong> There are a number of continuing education courses that are available on fraud and fraud prevention. Taking these courses can help fraud law professionals stay up-to-date on the latest trends and developments in the field. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By taking these steps, fraud law professionals can stay one step ahead of the criminals and protect their clients from fraud. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Staying Ahead: Your Arsenal Against Fraud </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the relentless fight against fraud, staying informed about emerging trends is not just an option—it is a necessity. The landscape of financial crime trends is ever-shifting, demanding our vigilance and adaptability. Detecting and preventing fraud requires a proactive approach, integrating risk assessment, detection methods and robust security measures. This not only protects critical financial transactions but also enhances the customer experience, minimizing customer friction. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Remember, fraud becomes more sophisticated and impactful each day, necessitating our constant effort to fight fraud. Together, as professionals in the financial services realm, we can implement new and creative ways to mitigate fraud, ensuring a safer environment for all. </p>

<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;""></span><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"">The pandemic devastated the global economy and governments found themselves bidding against one another to secure vaccines and medical and protective equipment supplies. Likewise, they needed to act fast and put together schemes that would save jobs and their national economies. They were forced to react, and the necessity for expediting schemes left them vulnerable to fraudsters.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;""></span><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"">There appears to be a reluctance and lack of political will to right wrongs. Those who stole public money during the pandemic should be seen repaying their ill-gotten gains. Otherwise, public confidence in national governments will be undermined. This is a matter of the highest public interest and demands action.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;""></span><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"">Forty percent of local U.K. councils failed to complete a questionnaire circulated by the Department for Business and Trade about the scale of the Covid business support scheme losses (which councils administered). This is unacceptable. It is now incumbent on the U.K. government and its global counterparts to think outside of the box in formulating solutions to these dreadful losses – and to think creatively about how to get some of the money back.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;""></span><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"">In my view, there needs to be a joint public/private sector partnership approach to redress such huge fraud losses to the public purse. The private sector has a deep bench of well trained and experienced asset recovery professionals (in fraud recovery lawyers, forensic accountants and fraud investigators). They are in place in all of the jurisdictions used by fraudsters to hide illicitly obtained assets (e.g., the Cayman Islands, Jersey, Switzerland, Singapore and Dubai). The public sector has tools which are very powerful in aid of asset recovery if used correctly (like MLAT Requests and Egmont Group financial intelligence requests). The combined strength of the public and private sectors in asset recovery would have a profoundly positive effect on the rate, value and frequency of recoveries.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;""></span><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"">Once the wheels of justice start spinning, and people see fraudsters’ assets stripped away from them, some public trust will start to return. In turn, there will be a queue of businesspeople who “didn’t realize that they had inadvertently made a false claim” doing their best to pay back what they have taken, rather than face prosecution, imprisonment and their assets frozen and seized.</span></p>

98,<h1>AI's Double-Edged Sword: How Fraudsters are Weaponizing Intelligence</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool with the potential to revolutionize industries and streamline processes. However, like any tool, AI can be wielded for malicious purposes. Fraudsters are increasingly leveraging AI to enhance the efficiency and sophistication of their scams.   </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Rise of AI in Fraud  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraudsters have embraced AI as a game-changer in their illicit activities. One prominent example is the use of AI-generated content, such as text, to manipulate and deceive individuals. ChatGPT, a large language model capable of generating human-like text, has been employed to create convincing messages, emails and even entire websites that mimic legitimate sources.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Social Engineering at Scale  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">AI-powered chatbots can engage in sophisticated social engineering attacks, manipulating individuals into divulging sensitive information. These bots, powered by advanced language models, can understand context, personalize messages and respond dynamically, making them highly effective in convincing unsuspecting targets to share personal or financial information.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Imagine receiving a message from what appears to be a legitimate company's customer support, seamlessly engaging in conversation and subtly extracting sensitive details. The AI-driven nature of these interactions makes it challenging for individuals to discern between genuine and fraudulent communications.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Automated Phishing Campaigns  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Phishing attacks, where fraudulent entities attempt to trick individuals into revealing confidential information, have also benefited from AI advancements. AI can optimize phishing campaigns by generating realistic emails that mimic official communications from banks, government agencies, organizations, companies or popular online platforms. These messages often contain malicious links or attachments, leading recipients to fake websites designed to steal login credentials or install malware.  </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>As a simple example, I asked this of ChatGPT:</strong>   </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">“Please write a short email for my small business website with these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">State that their account has been accessed by someone else.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">State that if that is not them, they need to change their password.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Include a link for them to change their password.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>And this was the response ChatGPT gave me:</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><img alt=""Chat GPT AI Blog"" src=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/images/shared/acfe-insights/ai-blog.png?h=363&amp;w=594&amp;hash=45C7D0D2B7D31ED794D4FA23108658D6"" style=""height: 363px; width: 594px;""/></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While the phishing email layout above is simplistic, fraudsters leverage AI to craft sophisticated and convincing emails, texts, deepfake calls or videos, websites and various other mediums. This enables them to effectively deceive and exploit vulnerable individuals, extracting sensitive information for malicious purposes.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Staying Vigilant Against AI-Powered Fraud  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As AI continues to play a role in fraudulent activities, it is crucial for individuals and organizations to stay vigilant. Here are some tips to protect yourself against AI-powered fraud:  </p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Verify the Source:</strong> Always verify the source of unexpected communications. If you receive a message, email or call requesting sensitive information, independently confirm the identity of the sender before sharing any details.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Check for Anomalies:</strong> Scrutinize messages for anomalies, such as unusual language, tone or requests. AI-generated content may lack the nuance and personal touch of genuine communication.    <strong></strong></li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Enable MFA whenever possible to add an extra layer of security. Even if login credentials are compromised, MFA can prevent unauthorized access.     <strong></strong></li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Educate Employees:</strong> Organizations should provide regular training to employees on recognizing and reporting potential AI-powered fraud. Awareness is a powerful defense against evolving threats.    </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Keep abreast of the latest developments in AI and cybersecurity. Understanding potential risks and emerging trends can empower individuals to make informed decisions and recognize potential threats.  </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While AI brings incredible benefits to various fields, its misuse by fraudsters poses a significant threat. By staying vigilant, adopting best practices and leveraging technological solutions, individuals and organizations can mitigate the risks associated with AI-powered fraud. As technology advances, so must our awareness and defenses against the potential threats of innovation.  </p>

100,<h1>Case Study: Florida Nurse Convicted of $200 Million Medicare Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Medicare fraud poses a significant threat to the integrity and sustainability of the Medicare program. Various estimates suggest Medicare fraud drains up to $60 billion from the healthcare system each year. This massive level of fraud not only harms taxpayers but also jeopardizes medical care for the 59 million Americans who rely on Medicare. With 10,000 new Medicare enrollees daily and rising healthcare costs, addressing fraud is crucial for Medicare's future solvency and ability to deliver services.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Types of Medicare Fraud  </h2>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Billing for services not performed - This is one of the most common types of fraud, where a provider bills Medicare for appointments, tests, procedures or other services that did not actually happen.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Misrepresenting services - Providers may bill for a more complex or expensive service than was performed in order to receive higher reimbursement. For example, billing for a 1-hour psychotherapy session when only a 15-minute medication management appointment was done.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Overcharging for services - Providers bill for unnecessary services, bill multiple times for the same service or charge excessively for services performed.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Kickbacks - Providers may receive kickbacks for referring patients to a specific healthcare company or for prescribing certain medical equipment and devices. This violates anti-kickback laws.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Identity theft - Fraudsters steal beneficiary ID numbers to submit false claims.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Case Study   </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A recent and troubling Medicare fraud case in Florida involved nurse practitioner Elizabeth Hernandez, who was convicted of <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/21/florida-nurse-practitioner-convicted-in-200-million-medicare-fraud-scheme.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">fraudulently billing over $200 million</span></a> for unnecessary orthotic braces and genetic testing. She participated in an elaborate telemarketing scheme that persuaded Medicare patients to request braces and tests they did not need.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Hernandez was sent pre-filled orders by the fraudulent telemarketing companies and signed off on them without ever examining or speaking to the patients - in some cases fraudulently claiming to have seen over 24 patients in a single day. She pocketed $1.6 million that she used for luxury cars, jewelry, home renovations and trips.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This type of fraud steals from taxpayers and compromises patient care. It also contributes to rising healthcare costs for all Americans. This highlights the importance of proper Medicare oversight and auditing controls to detect such large-scale fraud.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This case exemplifies the relevance of consumer education so that Medicare beneficiaries understand their rights and are not taken advantage of by fraudulent schemes. Patients should be cautious of any provider who bills Medicare for services or equipment that seem unnecessary or for appointments that did not occur.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As this case demonstrates, Medicare fraud often involves large criminal networks intent on stealing billions, not just isolated incidents of overbilling. Comprehensive anti-fraud measures are needed to prevent such schemes and protect Medicare for future generations. With proper safeguards against unethical providers, improved auditing and consumer education, the program can continue fulfilling its vital purpose of providing healthcare for Americans who rely on Medicare’s services.  </p>

101,<h1>Prosecution and Penalties of White-Collar Crimes</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Stephanie Gordon </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>This article is the first in a three-part series spotlighting investigating white-collar crimes.  </em> </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Often linked to organized crime, white-collar crimes pose a persistent challenge today. These are usually nonviolent crimes like identity theft, mortgage fraud, computer crimes and tax evasion. To bring the culprits to justice, it's important to prosecute them rigorously.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There are unique hurdles to overcome when dealing with legal proceedings for these crimes. Criminals often use elaborate tricks to hide their true intentions, making it crucial for law enforcement to use creative strategies when prosecuting them. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Bringing White-Collar Criminals to Justice </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Prosecuting white-collar criminals is crucial to maintaining financial markets' integrity and protecting innocent victims. These crimes are usually committed by persons seeking to obtain money or gain an unfair advantage, often through complex schemes that defy easy detection. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Federal laws, such as those against antitrust violations and tax crimes, have been signed into law to address these issues. However, successful prosecutions require a deep understanding of the specific type of fraud involved: mortgage fraud, identity theft or other financial crimes. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Penalties for White-Collar Criminals </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">White-collar criminals can face severe penalties, including fines, imprisonment and restitution to victims. These penalties serve not only as punishment but also as a deterrent against future criminal activity. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By examining case studies of successful prosecutions, we can gain insights into the effectiveness of these penalties and their role in curbing white-collar crime.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Lessons learned from notable convictions underscore the importance of a strong legal framework and the relentless pursuit of justice in upholding the law and protecting the financial well-being of individuals and the U.S. economy.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The battle against white-collar crimes remains an ongoing struggle in the ever-evolving landscape of financial misconduct. As we've seen, these offenses, whether involving mortgage fraud, identity theft or computer crimes, continue to adapt and challenge our legal systems. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In this fight, anti-fraud professionals play a crucial role in safeguarding society's interests and financial stability. We must recognize the importance of legal tools and techniques in investigating these complex cases, ensuring that justice prevails. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As we move forward, we must encourage vigilance and accountability in the corporate world, where many white-collar crimes take root. Only through collective efforts and a commitment to upholding the law can we hope to deter and combat these insidious acts effectively. </p>

102,<h1>The Investigative Process of White-Collar Crimes</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Stephanie Gordon </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>This article is part of a three-part series spotlighting investigating white-collar crimes. </em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The investigative process is essential for uncovering crimes, particularly white-collar crimes. These are crimes committed by individuals, organizations or public officials for financial gain, often without resorting to violence. Edwin Sutherland, one of the pioneers in this field, recognized the complex nature of these offenses.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Gathering Evidence </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It is critical to collect evidence. Gathering evidence includes using legal tools, such as those used by agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and mortgage commissions. These tools help uncover hidden facts in cases involving financial institutions, insurance fraud or obstruction of justice. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">However, obtaining evidence of white-collar crime is not easy. Perpetrators often use deception to cover their tracks, making it difficult to uncover their misdeeds. Despite these challenges, investigators persevere to find the truth, as the evidence collected is essential for bringing criminals to justice. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Structuring the Investigation  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Think of structuring the investigation as crafting a compelling story unraveling the crime committed. Investigators painstakingly connect the dots, revealing how the crime was carried out. This phase requires close collaboration with relevant agencies and experts to ensure a solid case.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Working closely with entities like healthcare fraud prosecutors is crucial in complex cases. Collaboration ensures no stone is left unturned, ensuring justice is served in intricate white-collar crime cases. Examining the Role of Organized Crime in White-Collar Offenses </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">White-collar crimes often intersect with organized crime groups, making investigations even more complex. Examining these connections sheds light on high-profile cases involving public officials and financial institutions. Leveraging Technology to Detect and Prevent White-Collar Crimes</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Technology is critical in fighting white-collar crimes in today's digital age. Plenty of solved cases demonstrate how technology helps uncover financial wrongdoing and prevent it from happening again. Technology highlights the importance of staying ahead in the constantly evolving landscape of crime prevention. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Legal Tools for Each Type of White-Collar Crime</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In white-collar crime investigations, a robust arsenal of legal tools is pivotal in unraveling the complex webs spun by individuals and entities involved in financial wrongdoing. We look into the multifaceted aspects of these indispensable instruments, shedding light on how they are employed to combat corporate misconduct and illicit financial activities. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Role of Regulatory Agencies </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Collaborating with regulatory agencies is one of the most important aspects of white-collar crime investigations. It echoes the pioneering work of sociologist Edwin Sutherland, who first coined ""white-collar crime."" These agencies, such as the SEC and the Mortgage Commission, act as watchdogs in the financial world, striving to maintain integrity and transparency.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Their functions include oversight, regulation, enforcement to deter and penalize corporate crime, securities fraud and other offenses. In cases where financial gain is prioritized over ethical conduct, the role of these agencies becomes even more critical. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Whistleblower Programs </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Whistleblower programs are another essential tool that encourages people with inside information to come forward and report white-collar crimes committed by individuals or organizations. This route allows conscientious citizens to report irregularities, such as healthcare fraud, insurance fraud or obstruction of justice, without fear of retaliation.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Whistleblower protections and rewards serve as incentives, providing a safety net for those willing to expose financial misconduct, thus making it easier to uncover hidden crimes that often involve deceit and nonviolent tactics. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Financial Analysis </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In financial analysis, experts proficiently navigate the intricacies of tracing illicit funds and assets. Their meticulous work aids prosecutors in assembling compelling cases against perpetrators of financial institution fraud and other common types of financial crimes. By meticulously following the money trail, they peel back the layers of concealment that often shroud these nefarious activities, bringing wrongdoers to justice. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Forensic Accounting </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Forensic accountants play an indispensable role in these investigations, applying their expertise to dissect complex financial transactions and provide invaluable insights. Their real-world applications span from organized crime cases to unraveling intricate schemes in corporate settings, demonstrating their versatility and significance in the pursuit of truth and accountability.  </p>

103,<h1>Investigating White-Collar Crimes: Legal Tools and Techniques</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Stephanie Gordon </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>This article is part of a three-part series spotlighting investigating white-collar crimes. </em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">White-collar crime, an insidious and complex category of offenses, extends far beyond the conventional image of criminal activity. Understanding white-collar crime is crucial for individuals and finance, law and security professionals in our interconnected world. This guide delves into the multifaceted landscape of white-collar offenses, illuminating the covert operations that underpin them. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Understanding White-Collar Crime </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">White-collar crime has serious consequences that go beyond financial losses, such as damaging the foundations of society. When public officials engage in corruption, people lose trust in the government. Securities fraud puts investments at risk, and embezzlement undermines the integrity of financial institutions.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This guide to white-collar crime will teach you how to investigate these offenses. We will also discuss the tools and techniques used by organizations like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which lead to combating these hidden dangers. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Securities Fraud </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Securities fraud is a white-collar crime involving fraudulent activities in the financial markets. It can range from the infamous Enron scandal, which shocked the world with its massive accounting fraud involving the manipulation of financial statements, to more recent cases of wire fraud and insider trading. Securities fraud perpetrators exploit the intricate web of financial systems for personal gain. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The consequences of securities fraud can reverberate throughout the economy, leading to plummeting stock prices, ruined livelihoods and tarnished corporate reputations. Investigating securities fraud demands a deep understanding of financial regulations, forensic accounting and cooperation with agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to bring perpetrators to justice. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Money Laundering </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Money laundering links criminal activity and legitimacy in the murky world of white-collar crime. This process allows perpetrators to conceal the illegal origins of funds, making them appear clean and legitimate. This crime reveals the harsh truth that these offenses frequently overlap, demonstrating how seemingly unrelated crimes, such as tax evasion or wire fraud, may be intricately linked in a web of financial deceit.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Corporate Fraud </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A different kind of white-collar crime emerges within corporate entities' boardrooms and balance sheets. Corporate fraud entails schemes designed to defraud investors, shareholders and the public. High-profile corporate fraud scandals, such as the Enron scandal, demonstrate the devastating consequences of such deception on a global scale.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Unraveling corporate fraud schemes necessitates financial acumen and legal expertise as investigators navigate complex webs of fraudulent transactions, counterfeit financial records and executive extortion. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Intellectual Property Theft </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Intellectual property theft has become a prevalent white-collar crime in an increasingly digital age. Perpetrators may engage in counterfeiting, patent infringement or unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material. This white-collar crime is a prime example of how technology has expanded the landscape of illicit activities, demanding innovative investigative techniques to safeguard intellectual property rights. </p>

105,<h1>The Hidden Storm: Understanding Fraud in the Wake of Natural Disasters</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires are devastating events that leave communities grappling with loss and destruction. While the focus is often on immediate relief and recovery, there is another aspect that frequently goes under the radar: <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/after-storms-watch-out-scams#:~:text=To%20report%20suspected%20fraud%2C%20call,%2D866%2D720%2D5721."" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">the surge in fraudulent activities</span></a> that exploit the chaos and vulnerability of these situations. In the aftermath of events like Hurricane Idalia and the wildfires in Hawaii, it is crucial to be aware of the various types of fraud that can emerge. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Many Faces of Disaster-Related Fraud </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud in the context of natural disasters can take on multiple forms, each with its own set of challenges for victims and authorities. Here are some of the most common types: </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Charity Fraud</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the wake of a disaster, the outpouring of generosity can be overwhelming. However, not all charitable organizations are what they seem. Fake charities often pop up to capitalize on the goodwill of people eager to help. These fraudulent entities collect donations but never channel the funds to actual relief efforts. A charity will never ask you to pay money for help, and neither will government programs, they should be reported to the FEMA Disaster Fraud Hotline toll free at 1-866-720-5721. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Contractor and Repair Scams</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When homes are damaged, quick repairs are a priority. This urgency creates a fertile ground for contractor scams. Fraudulent contractors may offer to perform repairs at a low cost but either deliver shoddy work or disappear after receiving an upfront payment. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Insurance Fraud </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Natural disasters often lead to a spike in insurance claims, making it easier for fraudulent claims to slip through the cracks. Some individuals or entities may exaggerate the extent of damage or file claims for properties that were not affected to receive payouts they are not entitled to. Other bad actors will act on behalf of an insurance company while having no association with the goal of stealing your personal information to commit identity fraud. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How to Protect Yourself </h2>
<ol>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Verify Charities: Always check the legitimacy of a charity through trusted platforms or government websites before making a donation. Consult trusted platforms like the <a href=""https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" style=""font-size: 13px;"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Better Business Bureau's Scam Tracker</span></a><span style=""font-size: 13px;"">, </span><a href=""https://www.charitynavigator.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" style=""font-size: 13px;"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Charity Navigator</span></a><span style=""font-size: 13px;""> or </span><a href=""https://www.charitywatch.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" style=""font-size: 13px;"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Charity Watch</span></a><span style=""font-size: 13px;""> for verification. </span></li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""font-size: 13px;""></span>Check Contractor Credentials: Before hiring anyone for repairs, verify their credentials, ask for references and never pay the full amount upfront. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Consult Your Insurance Company: Before filing a claim, consult with your insurance company about the proper procedures to follow to ensure you are not inadvertently involved in fraud. </li>
</ol>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Natural disasters are a time of upheaval and vulnerability, making them ripe for various types of fraud. By being aware of the risks and taking proactive steps, you can protect yourself and ensure that aid goes to those who genuinely need it. Whether it is the aftermath of a hurricane like Idalia or wildfires like those in Hawaii, vigilance and education are your best defenses against becoming a victim of fraud. </p>

106,<h1>Public and Private Partnership in Information Sharing to Combat Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Lin Danwan, CFE </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In recent years, fraudulent schemes have been on the rise, evolving constantly in their modus operandi. To counter this growing threat, information sharing mechanisms related to fraud detection and prevention have advanced significantly. Notably, an increasing number of fraudulent information-sharing initiatives are now adopting a public-private partnership approach, involving cooperation between government agencies, law enforcement and private sector entities. This collaborative model leverages the expertise and resources of both sectors to create a more comprehensive and effective response to fraud. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Trend in Fraud Information Sharing: Public-Private Partnerships</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Traditionally, collaboration against fraud was confined to private actors, such as banks. However, the public-private partnership approach is now being increasingly utilized to combat fraud. Initiatives like, the Fraud &amp; Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (FMLIT) in Hong Kong and the Fintel Alliance launched by Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) in Australia, exemplify such joint efforts. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In this model, public agencies possess legal authority and access to intelligence, while private companies hold real-time data and cutting-edge technologies. This accelerates information sharing, reduces response time and enhances the overall understanding of the threat landscape. Proactive measures can then be taken against fraud, leading to more cost-effective solutions. The partnership also seeks to adopt a more efficient and systemic approach with the support of information technology, as seen in initiatives like Financial Intelligence Evaluation Sharing Tool (FINEST) in Hong Kong.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Challenges to Public-Private Partnership of Fraud Information Sharing </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While partnerships can be effective in combating fraud, they do come with some challenges that need to be addressed. It is essential to balance the liabilities and benefits of such partnerships, with some of the concerns easily noted including information security, protection of privacy interests and potential conflicts of interest. </p>
<ol>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Data privacy concerns</strong>: Private companies often handle customer data carefully and share with government agencies only under specific regulatory requirements. Striking a balance between the purpose for fraud prevention and detection, and protecting individual privacy is uneasy and requires the establishment of a certain legal framework delineating the purpose and scope.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Information security under this partnership</strong>: The scope of the shared information, the sharing channel or system, technical components that constitute the sharing solution necessitate deliberation and befitting technological development to ensure robust information security.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Differing priorities and liability model</strong>: Public and private entities may have distinct proprietary concerns and nuanced priorities. Aligning these priorities and setting common goals is essential for effective collaboration. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Legal and regulatory challenges</strong>: Many private companies operate with global jurisdictional coverage; the varying legal and regulatory frameworks complicate cross-border information sharing and cooperation. </li>
</ol>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Accordingly, the solutions are expected to cover the below dimensions:  </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Liability Model Setting</h3>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Clear legal frameworks</strong>: Legal agreements and frameworks should be established, outlining the scope of information sharing, data protection, liability and the specific purposes for which data can be used. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Roles and responsibilities</strong>: Establishing a partnership guideline to define the roles and responsibilities under the collaboration model is crucial to all stakeholders involved.  </li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Framework / Mechanism Setting</h3>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Standardized data formats</strong>: Encouraging the use of standardized data formats and sharing protocols can simplify and streamline the exchange of information between public and private entities. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Incident response plans</strong>: Developing incident response plans that involve both public and private stakeholders can ensure a coordinated and efficient response to fraud incidents. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Public-Private dialogues</strong>: Collaboration can be strengthened by establishing regular forums and working groups where representatives from both sectors can meet and discuss common challenges and solutions. </li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Reliable Technical Support</h3>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Cybersecurity capacity building</strong>: Supporting capacity building programs for both public agencies and private companies can enhance their ability to detect, prevent and respond to fraud and cyber threats. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An operable partnership requires rigorous model setting, defined roles and responsibilities, technical commitment and a shared understanding of the benefits of collaboration. With these in place, public and private sectors can create a more resilient and effective defense against fraud. By embracing the public-private partnership approach to information sharing, we can collectively stay one step ahead of the evolving fraud landscape and protect the integrity of financial systems worldwide. </p>

107,<h1>Don’t Get Hooked by the Geek Squad Phishing Scam</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A new phishing scam preying on Best Buy customers is making the rounds. The fraudulent email claims to be from Best Buy's tech support team Geek Squad and tricks users into giving away personal information. Do not take the bait — this is what you need to know to avoid becoming a victim. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The phishing attempt starts with an <a href=""https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2022/10/how-recognize-fake-geek-squad-renewal-scam"">email appearing to come from Geek Squad</a>, usually referencing a charge for hundreds of dollars on the recipient's Best Buy account to renew their Geek Squad membership. It prompts the user to call a phone number to cancel or renew their membership within 24 hours. If you call the phone number, they will ask for remote access to your computer under the guise of helping with your Geek Squad account. In reality, scammers can use it to install malware programs to steal private information. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Unfortunately, this scam is quite convincing. The email contains official Best Buy branding and images, and the sender address appears legitimate at first glance. Even the web page mimics the real Best Buy login. However, telltale signs reveal the ruse for those who know what to look for. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How to Detect and Prevent a Geek Squad Phishing Scam </h2>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Contact Geek Squad if concerned. Use official contact info from the company website, not the information in the dubious email.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Watch for poor spelling, grammar or unrealistic threats. Legitimate businesses typically do not make these mistakes.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Inspect the sender’s email address. The fake messages come from accounts unrelated to Best Buy.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Never give sensitive information or payment in response to an unsolicited email. Contact the company through official channels instead. If you shared personal or financial details, change passwords, alert your bank and continue to monitor for fraudulent activity. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Do not click suspicious links or attachments as they have a high possibility of containing malware. Instead, login through BestBuy.com directly to check for any unusual activity. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Use security software to detect and block suspicious senders. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Report phishing attempts to the Federal Trade Commission at <a href=""http://ReportFraud.ftc.gov"">ReportFraud.ftc.gov</a> and forward the email to <a href=""mailto:reportphishing@apwg.org"">reportphishing@apwg.org</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This technique is not unique to Geek Squad. Cybercriminals constantly impersonate trusted brands via phishing to access consumer data and money. These scams recently involved major companies like Amazon, Apple, Chase Bank, Facebook, Microsoft and more. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Stay vigilant to protect yourself from phishing. Crooks get craftier as security improves. But a little caution goes a long way in avoiding becoming their next victim. Do not take the bait with the Geek Squad scam or any other suspicious emails. Use secure practices to keep attackers at bay. </p>

108,<h1>Essential Steps for Protecting Your Company in a Fraud Investigation</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Natalie S. Lewis, CFE, CPA/CFF</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud is a pervasive issue that affects businesses, organizations and individuals across various industries. Often, an organization is surprised to find itself a victim of fraud, especially when the perpetrator is a trusted employee. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners <a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2022/""><em>Occupational Fraud 2022: A Report to the Nations</em></a>, organizations lose approximately five percent of revenue to fraud each year with the average loss per case totaling more than $1.78 million. Chances are if an organization has not yet discovered fraudulent activity within the company, it is only a matter of time. It is important for organizations to remain vigilant and prepared to handle the situation carefully and responsibly once fraud arises. Fraud investigations are complex and multifaceted processes that require a systematic approach. For many companies and owners, this is unfamiliar territory, and most are unsure what to do once fraud is discovered.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Initial Steps </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As a business owner or executive, it is important to follow these initial steps in order to protect your company from fraud, as they are crucial to a successful investigation: </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Assemble your team of professionals.</strong> Once you suspect fraud has occurred within your organization, your first step should be lining up your team of professionals skilled in conducting fraud investigations. The team should be comprised of outside legal counsel, a forensic accountant and a computer forensic specialist. While in-house counsel and accounting staff may be included in meetings and discussions, attorneys and forensic accountants experienced in investigations can independently conduct interviews and perform analysis with a neutral perspective. For further consideration, an employment attorney can guide you on the appropriate and legal way to handle the suspected employee. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The investigative team will define the scope of the probe, establish clear communication about the division of responsibilities and ensure compliance with legal and ethical requirements.  Investigators must collaborate with legal professionals to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations and rules of evidence. When selecting your team of professionals, certain skillsets should be considered, such as interviewing, financial analysis and data analytics, and potentially other technical specialties depending on the facts and circumstances.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Forensic accountants and fraud investigators are trained to examine and analyze financial records. These records will include financial statements, bank records, transactional data and other relevant documents to identify irregularities, discrepancies or patterns indicative of fraudulent activities. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Throughout the investigation, the team will likely need to interact, or possibly interview, key personnel within the organization and from various departments. Interviews play a crucial role in uncovering fraudulent activities. Interviewing witnesses, victims, suspects and relevant individuals can provide valuable insights, help corroborate evidence and aid in identifying potential perpetrators. Selecting a team of professionals skilled in interviewing techniques and behavioral analysis should be considered.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Information should be distributed with care and consideration. In addition, the investigation team should establish confidentiality guidelines for all parties involved to prevent leaks and/or misinformation. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Inform necessary parties.</strong> Once your organization learns of a substantiated fraud claim, certain parties should be notified of the investigation, such as your company’s board of directors, internal audit department, human resources and management. While certain key personnel may need to be informed about the allegations, your team of professionals may wish to keep most information related to the investigation concealed as they determine all involved parties, including if suspects were colluding together in the scheme.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another party that should be notified as soon as a loss is determined is your insurance company. For many organizations, their business insurance policy includes coverage for employee dishonesty or other coverage for fraudulent activity, known as fidelity or commercial crime insurance. To file a claim, you must notify your insurance carrier once a loss has been discovered. You will want to review your policy to ensure you adhere to the requirements necessary when filing a claim, such as the notification window and the company’s response once a loss is discovered. Further, your policy may include coverage for claims preparation which would reimburse the company for professional fees incurred to investigate and quantify the covered loss.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Restrict suspect’s access.</strong> When assembling your team, ensure that you protect your organization from further damage by removing the suspected employee’s access to the company’s systems, corporate credit card and other physical assets. In addition, your human resources officer and employment attorney may advise you to place the suspect employee(s) on a leave of absence during the investigation before termination.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Gather and preserve evidence.</strong> Gathering and preserving all evidence is crucial for possible civil and/or criminal court proceedings and potentially a fidelity insurance claim.  Investigators must promptly secure physical and electronic evidence while ensuring proper documentation, chain of custody and forensic best practices to maintain integrity and admissibility. This involves seizing documents, electronic data, conducting interviews, using specialized tools and capturing ephemeral messaging. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Document investigative procedures and findings.</strong> Thoroughly document all actions, interviews, findings and evidence collected throughout the investigation. Comprehensive records of the investigation process support the development of a cohesive narrative and facilitates effective communication with stakeholders and legal authorities. The investigative team should compile a final report detailing the investigative process, interviews, witness statements, documents, financial analysis and recommendations for strengthening internal controls.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Implement Recommended Corrective Measures.</strong> Investigative reports assess vulnerabilities and recommend corrective measures to strengthen internal controls. It is essential to leverage the lessons learned from each investigation to continuously improve fraud prevention and detection mechanisms, enhancing organizational resilience. Evaluate existing internal controls and security measures to identify any weaknesses that may have allowed the incident. Strengthen these controls to prevent future fraud and protect the company’s assets.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Conducting a successful fraud investigation requires meticulous planning, thorough execution and collaboration among investigators, experts and legal professionals. Throughout the investigative process, it is important to handle the situation legally, professionally and ethically. By following the outlined steps and adhering to best practices, investigators can maximize their chances of uncovering fraud, mitigating losses and implementing preventive measures to safeguard against future fraudulent activities.  </p>

109,<h1>Too Good to be True? 4 Ways to Avoid Vacation Rental Scams</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Booking a vacation rental online comes with the convenience of browsing listings from the comfort of home. But it also opens the door to scammers trying to take advantage of unsuspecting travelers. Vacation rental fraud often involves fake property listings, compromised accounts, bait-and-switch tactics, double bookings and other deceptive practices targeting short-term rental guests. Being aware of the common types of vacation rental scams and red flags can help you identify fraudulent behavior and even avoid becoming the victim.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Common Types of Vacation Rental Scams</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fake listings are among the most common vacation rental scams. Fraudsters create convincing listings for properties that either do not exist or are not actually available for rent. When an unsuspecting guest tries to book, the “host” collects payment and often ceases communication shortly after that.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Account takeover scams involve fraudsters hacking into real rental accounts on sites like Airbnb or VRBO. They then change the listing details and rent out the property as if they are the real owner. By the time the actual owner finds out, the guest has already sent payment to the scammer.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Bait-and-switch scams use fake photos of a luxury property to lure guests in. But when the guest arrives, the property is completely different, usually run down and nothing like what was advertised.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Double booking scams happen when a host books the same rental property to multiple guests for overlapping dates. The guest who arrives last gets left scrambling when the home is already occupied.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Red Flags of Vacation Rental Fraud</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Listings with limited photos, details and reviews, or that seem “too good to be true” should raise red flags. Also, be suspicious of prices drastically lower than comparable rentals in the same area. Fraudsters often target the most vulnerable in their schemes. By offering well-below-average prices on fake rentals, people who do not have much money to spend in the first place become targets for this kind of tactic.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A host who pushes you to book or pay outside of the rental platform is another huge red flag. Legitimate hosts will have you book and pay through the platform, which offers protection. Contact info that differs between the listing and booking is also suspicious and should be verified through the platform primarily.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Avoiding vacation rental fraud starts by understanding red flags of potentially fraudulent behavior. Anyone booking vacation rentals should always:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Verify the host through the rental platform.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Search the listing address to confirm it is a rental property, not someone’s residence.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Always book and pay through the platform, not directly with a host. Use payment methods with fraud protections that are built in.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Consider rental guarantee insurance that can reimburse you if fraud does occur. Before the trip, confirm all the details with the host again. This helps uncover any bait-and-switch schemes ahead of time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What to Do if You Are a Victim</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If you are the victim of a vacation rental scam, immediately contact the rental platform if you booked through one and dispute the charges with your bank or credit card company. You can also contact local law enforcement and file complaints with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) if the scam took place in the U.S. Victims might also consider reporting identity theft if any personal information was compromised. Once personal situations are addressed, it’s helpful to leave online reviews about the fraud to warn others of similar schemes on that particular property or even in the area.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Being vigilant can help travelers avoid falling prey to vacation rental scams. Do your due diligence on listings, hosts and payments to ensure your next vacation rental experience is smooth sailing.</p>

110,<h1>Fresh Estate Fraud Case Unfolds In South Carolina</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>By: Brett Darken</p>
<p><span style=""white-space-collapse: preserve;"">A new estate fraud case is center-stage in South Carolina’s courts.  </span></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Palmetto state has been a hotbed of probate, trust and conservator fraud cases dating back more than half a decade: In March 2023, attorney Alex Murdaugh was convicted of murdering his wife and son. But years before the high-profile attorney was tried for murder, Murdaugh was tied to the disappearance of $4.2 million of his client’s insurance money, of which he was a trustee. Months before the Murdaugh trial, Russell Laffitte, the CEO of Palmetto State Bank, was convicted of fraud in federal court for using the money of his trust clients to make loans that were hidden from and did not benefit his trust clients. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Court Authorized Fraud</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Probate, estate and conservatorship fraud presents unique challenges to fraud investigators. Estate investigations are cross-disciplinary and often involve the language of the law colliding with the numbers of finance and accounting. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The new South Carolina case rises out of the estate of Carlos Hanna, who died in 2010. The estate has bounced around South Carolina’s courts for more than a decade, but it jumped into the headlines about six weeks ago when the family noticed that the court appointed conservator, Jeffrey Robinson, tried to sell the home of Georgia “Jo” Hanna out of Jo’s conservatorship— Jo is a dementia patient living in a memory-care facility.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Robinson is the treasurer of Darlington County, South Carolina. On the side, he works as a financial advisor and fiduciary. In the Hanna case, Robinson had been appointed as the conservator of Jo by Darlington County probate judge Marvin Lawson.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">On April 18, 2023, attorney Charles E. Ipock wrote a letter to Judge Lawson. Ipock is a member of Haynesworth-Sinkler-Boyd, a law firm with more than 100 attorneys and multiple offices in South Carolina. On behalf of Robinson, Ipock asked Judge Lawson to issue an order to Robinson, as conservator, that gave the court’s approval to sell the house in which Jo Hanna lived before needing memory care. Ipock’s letter to Judge Lawson contained just two paragraphs. In it, Ipock writes:</p>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: center;""> <em>“As you will note, I request an Order of the Court </em><strong><em>without notice</em></strong><em> as allowed under South Carolina Probate Code.” </em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Ipock then cited the section of South Carolina legal code that allows a conservator to do things “without notice.” In short, Ipock and Robinson wanted Judge Lawson to issue a court order without telling the family. Days later, on April 24, Judge Lawson issued the order as Ipock had requested: Judge Lawson approved Robinson’s request to sell Jo’s house “without notice.”</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Attorney Finds the Fraud</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Darlington County South Carolina has fewer than 70,000 people. It did not take long for the Hanna family to learn that Robinson, Ipock and Lawson had secretly agreed to sell Jo Hanna’s home and conceal the sale from the Hanna family. One of Jo’s children, Craig Hanna, and his wife Dana, contacted attorney Tucker Player in Columbia, South Carolina. Tucker Player’s keen eye for detail stopped the sale of the home “without notice.” Here’s how he did it:</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Non-Financial Deceptions</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud is a unique type of theft because it is theft based on deception. In the Hanna case, the deception was unique: It wasn’t found in a brokerage statement, inflated invoice or a deflated appraisal. In this case, attorney Player found a subtle and sophisticated deception used by Ipock that twisted the language of South Carolina’s law.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Player found that in Ipock’s motion to Judge Lawson, Ipock cited a specific statute in the code of South Carolina to support his request for an order “without notice.” The statute cited by Ipock deals with the actions of trustees and conservators (SC § 62-5-428). Clear as day, the South Carolina code says that conservators can ask a judge to issue orders “without notice” for a list of things. At first glance, attorney Ipock’s request appears to comply with the law. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">But Player drilled into the details of the legal code. He found that all of the things that can be done in a South Carolina conservatorship “without notice” are clerical or administrative events (e.g., Increase the bond, ask for an accounting; pay funeral expenses, etc.). As Player cited in his May 18 filing with the South Carolina Supreme Court: </p>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: center;""><em>“Nowhere in this statute does it allow any court to dispose of property without notice. The only actions that can be taken without notice are those actions specifically enumerated….”</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Player’s granular dive into the legal code uncovered the deception in the real estate sale and his work delivered powerful results: Within days of filing his written complaint to the court, the sale was halted, and both Judge Lawson and conservator Jeffrey Robinson resigned from the case. Attorney Charles Ipock at Haynesworth-Sinkler-Boyd has not replied to emails seeking comment on the case, nor has Jeffrey Robinson. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Hanna estate has been open in South Carolina’s courts for more than a decade. Now that the forensic efforts have begun in earnest, the case will provide insights into the legal and accounting tricks used by financial predators to target their victims. It also will show how families and fraud fighters can defend themselves against fraud, embezzlement, theft and racketeering in their estates. </p>

111,<h1>Fraud and Injustice: A Global Crisis in Indigenous Communities</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Indigenous peoples around the world face marginalization and exploitation, leading to increased vulnerability. This puts them at a particular risk for fraud, as opportunistic fraudsters take advantage of systemic inequalities. Fraud against indigenous communities is especially harmful due to the unique challenges these groups face. Factors like geographic isolation, lack of access to resources and cultural marginalization leave indigenous peoples vulnerable to exploitation in ways other groups may not experience. Recent cases showcase how fraud scams indigenous groups across the globe. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""> Given the marginalization indigenous groups face, they often <a href=""https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/mandated-areas1/health.html"">suffer from higher rates of poverty</a> and lower access to health care and education. This leads to less awareness around fraud risks and fewer resources to recover from fraud harms. Geographic isolation also limits information sharing and support networks. Indigenous cultures face marginalization and dismissal within majority societies, allowing fraudsters to target them while avoiding scrutiny. Ultimately, fraud perpetuates the cycle of injustice experienced by these communities. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Recent examples of this troubling trend:</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the Navajo Nation, an <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/08/31/1196855614/fake-sober-homes-targeting-native-americans-scam-millions-from-taxpayers"">identity theft ring targeted tribal members</a>. Fraudsters used victims’ personal information to bill Medicaid for $12 million in fake rehabilitation services between 2016-2019. Many of the victims were elderly individuals who did not speak English, allowing the scheme to operate undetected for years. This scam diverted critical health care resources from an already underserved community. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Some fraudsters <a href=""https://www.analystnews.org/posts/the-pretendians-exploiting-indigenous-communities-through-identity-fraud"">misrepresent their indigenous identity</a> for profit, known as “pretendians.” One notable example is Andrea Smith, a professor of Native American studies who was later exposed for not having the Cherokee heritage she had claimed. She exploited her fictional identity to obtain grants, speaking engagements and other opportunities intended for indigenous peoples. Such fraudulent actions allow scammers to profit from marginalized identities while taking resources from authentic indigenous communities. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In Australia, there is a <a href=""https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/scam-losses-to-culturally-diverse-communities-people-with-disability-and-indigenous-australians-almost-doubled-in-2021"">concerning rise in scams</a> that specifically target Aboriginal communities. Tactics include high-pressure sales, offers of free prizes and unauthorized withdrawals from bank accounts.  Aboriginal communities are particularly susceptible to these schemes due to language barriers, financial inexperience and geographic isolation. Additionally, there is often stigma associated with reporting such incidents, coupled with a general distrust of authorities, making it challenging for victims to seek assistance. This combination of factors enables scammers to operate with near impunity. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another insidious tactic involves <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/university-of-saskatchewan-website-1.6767367"">fake indigenous organizations</a> or charities to solicit donations. For example, the “Saskatchewan Indigenous Cultural Centre,” was a fraudulent organization that falsely claimed on its website that it represented 60 First Nations bands. The site requested donations for educational programs that didn’t exist. These fraudulent groups take advantage of the public’s goodwill towards indigenous causes, ultimately embezzling funds. (CBC, 2023) </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">These examples illustrate the diverse nature of fraud against indigenous groups, all of which have disproportionately large impacts due to the social, economic and political marginalization these communities endure. Addressing the root causes of fraud is essential to its prevention. This might involve improving delivery of health care, promoting financial literacy, increasing internet access or fostering greater trust between authorities and indigenous people. Through more thoughtful solutions, we can combat the exploitation of vulnerable communities and create a more just society.</p>

112,<h1>Catch Me If You Con: Frank Abagnale Jr. and the Resurgence of Check Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">The name Frank Abagnale Jr. is synonymous with check fraud and counterfeiting. His story, which was popularized in the 2002 film ""Catch Me If You Can,"" starred Leonardo DiCaprio as the master imposter himself. Starting when he was just a teenager in the mid- to late-1960s, Abagnale managed to defraud banks and businesses out of more than $2.5 million by forging fraudulent checks. By the time he was finally apprehended by the FBI at age 21, he had cashed more than 17,000 bad checks across 26 countries.</span></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Though times have changed nearly 60 years later, Abagnale's schemes serve as a warning to banks and businesses to be on high alert for check fraud. </span></p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000;""></span><span style=""color: #000000;"">The Resurgence of Check Fraud</span></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000;""></span><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Check fraud is on the rise again, though today's schemes look different than in past decades. Rather than relying solely on forging payroll checks like Frank Abagnale Jr., modern check fraud involves multiple players and more complex operations.</span></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""></span><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Criminals now target personal checks, business checks, tax refund checks and checks related to government assistance programs, such as Social Security or unemployment payments by mailbox-fishing and identifying specific envelopes likely to contain checks. Once acquired, fraudsters employ a technique called check washing in which they use common household chemicals to erase key details like the payee’s name and payment amount, while leaving the issuer's signature intact. The checks are then dried and re-written for modest amounts to avoid suspicion and remain within the account balance.</span></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""></span><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">In 2021, United States financial institutions reported more than 350,000 cases of potential check fraud to the </span><a href=""https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-alert-nationwide-surge-mail-theft-related-check-fraud-schemes-targeting"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</a><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">, which was a 23% increase from 2020. The upward trend continued in 2022 with the number of potential check fraud cases reported reaching more than 680,000, almost double the reports from 2021. </span></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""></span><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Banks are struggling to keep up with the rising tide of fraud, a persistent issue that continues to evolve into new sophisticated forms. The three most prevalent check fraud schemes currently involve stealing canceled checks and statements to obtain new checks, check washing and stealing blank check stock. While banks used to reimburse defrauded customers within days, the surge in cases has significantly slowed the refund process. As times have changed, both banks and customers alike must remain vigilant against these evolving criminal schemes, particularly those targeting checks and mail theft.</span></p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""></span><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Ways a Fraud Examiner Can Identify Check Fraud</span></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""></span><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">A fraud examiner has several techniques at their disposal to catch check fraud in its tracks. One method is to verify check number sequences to see if any checks are missing or stolen. If suspicious activity is found, payment can then be stopped on those checks. Additionally, fraud examiners should closely analyze expense and payroll checks made out to employee names o</span><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"">simply “cash” to identify unauthorized payments disguising fraudulent activity.</span></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""></span><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">The check register itself can provide key insights through careful examination — an investigator can look for duplicate check numbers, checks made out on the same date for the exact same dollar amount, but to different payees, or checks without any related invoices in the financial system. Making note of purchases without purchase orders can also help uncover bogus checks being cut.</span></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""></span><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">By thoroughly employing these methods of validating check numbers, examining payee names closely, watching for duplicates, confirming document trails and identifying suspicious purchases, a diligent fraud examiner can catch many forms of check fraud and prevent further financial damage.</span></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""></span><span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">While check fraud has evolved over the decades, the underlying issue persists. Modern schemes show criminals continuously adapt their techniques to exploit financial systems. As in Abagnale's time, ongoing vigilance and timely responses are key for banks and businesses to mitigate losses from the resurgence of check fraud.</span></p>

113,<h1>A Positive Step for British Banks and Shared Information</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em></em>By: Tony McClements, Head of Investigations at Martin Kenney &amp; Co (MKS)</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Reuters <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/uk-banks-ramp-up-data-sharing-dirty-money-crackdown-2023-06-22/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">recently reported</span></a> that more than half a dozen British banks were in advanced talks with law enforcement and government agencies over plans to systematically share intelligence on major financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorism financing. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Two landmark pilots are expected to launch within months. The moves follow Britain recently launching a <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/uk/2023/04/05/stop-pussyfooting-britain-needs-to-rewrite-the-rules-on-economic-crime/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">new economic crime plan</span></a> and a <a href=""https://martinkenney.com/2023/05/23/uk-fraud-strategy-leaves-police-outgunned/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">national fraud strategy</span></a> as the country grapples with the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and London’s previous unenviable reputation as “<a href=""https://www.tortoisemedia.com/listen/londongrad/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Londongrad</span>.</a>”  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The agreement in the offing between the banks, including Lloyds and NatWest, will create protocols and systems for sharing information should be broadly welcomed. The objective of this proposal is <a href=""https://uk.style.yahoo.com/uk-banks-ramp-data-sharing-060751651.html#:~:text=%22Banks%20are%20the%20first%20line,welcomed,%22%20he%20told%20Reuters."" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">summed up succinctly</span></a> by Simon Fell, vice chair of a parliamentary anti-corruption group, who said, “So, any new mechanisms to share information that could help track down criminals, while respecting sensible privacy rights, is welcomed.”  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The information held by banks is quite rightly considered sensitive and demands firewalling. This data provides a deep insight into an individual’s or corporate entity’s most private information. However, there are instances where this right to privacy is exploited by the unscrupulous. The reliance on confidentiality can be manipulated by the corrupt, tax evaders, drug dealers and even terrorists. Banks are in the money-laundering frontline, an invidious situation where they can often never do right for doing wrong. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When it spots something dubious, the normal response is for a bank to generate a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). However, SAR systems in most countries, especially the U.K., are overrun and failing in their law enforcement objective. Banks are spending vast sums complying with their regulatory obligations, only for the intelligence they generate through SARs to disappear into an information black hole that is the SAR regime. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Where is the system failing? It is difficult to apportion blame. Banks often generate “defensive” or “just-in-case” reports. Given the severity of potential sanctions, it is difficult to criticize banks for adopting this position. Unfortunately, such reports can often clog up the system, generating a situation where it is difficult to see the “wood for the trees.”  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Likewise, law enforcement has had to cut its cloth to adjust to severe budgetary constraints. These limitations mean that a large number of SARs, which could otherwise generate meaningful and useful intelligence, slip through the cracks. Even when the banks submit a “good” SAR, there is no guarantee that it will see the light of day in a policing context. The SARs system is flawed, but it can also never be perfect due to the human factors inherent within the system.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It should be emphasized that what may be suspicious to one person is not necessarily considered shady by another. In addition, the banks also suffer, as does law enforcement, from corporate and geographical boundaries that create silos. These repositories can unintentionally create a situation where the left hand does not know what the right is doing.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In law enforcement, this can result in “blue-on-blue” scenarios, where the same suspect is being investigated by multiple agencies—all oblivious to one another’s investigations. It shouldn’t happen, but it does. The banks are no different: Unless they can liaise with one another, the jigsaw will never be complete. Being able to secure this overview is essential. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Yet the fear of breaching privacy laws has prevented banks from speaking to one another, even when they have had good cause to do so. The key phrase for me in these new measures is “respecting sensible privacy rights.” It makes sense to me that those in the inner circles of banking should be able to establish an information exchange. As long as the information is not being disclosed outside of the finance members’ tight network, there should be no need for concern. If a number of banks have a customer common to them all, and all are suspicious for similar or even different reasons, then the resultant SAR will carry with it much more significance and gravitas. The mere fact that several banks will now combine efforts to raise concerns should push that SAR towards the top of the law enforcement in tray. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Yet the mechanics of this information-sharing plan are unknown. Indeed, several of the banks are refusing to comment or even confirm their participation in the trial. To my mind, empowering the process by which banks will be able to lawfully liaise with each other and share their concerns needs to be formalized as soon as possible. The banks will benefit from being able to discuss developing situations. Law enforcement will benefit from enhanced intelligence. And the SARs system will potentially benefit too, as the number of SARs should decrease — even if only marginally — as only one report would be generated, rather than several SARs all highlighting the same individual. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">All in all, I consider this proposal to be a positive step in the fight against financial crime and money laundering. </p>

114,<h1>Through the Looking Glass: Spotting MLMs and Pyramid Schemes</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Abbie Staiger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Multi-level marketing (MLM) companies and pyramid schemes share similarities like recruitment-focused structures but have key differences, such as the sale of products in MLMs versus pyramid schemes that redistribute payments and fees to early investors. However, some MLMs still prioritize enrolling distributors over product sales to help scale and grow. This warrants examination as MLMs promote flexibility and big earning potential, but the reality is very difficult for most participants.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">MLMs saturate markets by tapping out social connections, making continued recruitment challenging. Their compensation plans favor top ranks while later distributors often struggle. For reference, just 13 cycles of each distributor recruiting six people exceeds the Earth's population, illustrating why most at the bottom of these marketing companies lose money from initial investments and inventory purchases. The touted income claims rarely match the actual experience of overwhelming market saturation, unequal pay and the endless need to recruit. With long odds against profiting, it is prudent to approach any new MLM with careful analysis as some of these companies take advantage of distributors and hide their true nature behind the veil of an authentic MLM.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Defining MLMs and Pyramid Schemes</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Multi-level marketing is a system where participants earn commissions on their personal product sales, as well as sales made by people they recruit. The focus is supposed to be selling products directly to customers.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In contrast, pyramid schemes are solely focused on recruiting new members into the funnel. Money flows upwards in a pyramid scheme to reward early investors with returns funded by later participants' fees. Pyramid schemes can also require participants to purchase and resell a set number of products regardless of if they are out of inventory or not, which causes serious financial strains, but gives off the impression that they are a multi-level marketing opportunity. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;"">There are several red flags that may indicate a fraudulent MLM or pyramid scheme:</span></p>

115,<h1>Fake Documents are on the Rise—Here are 3 Trends to Watch</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Ronan Burke, CEO of Inscribe</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Anna Sorokin, the so-called “fake German heiress” (perhaps better known by her alias Anna Delvey), came dangerously close to duping a hedge fund out of $25 million.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">According to<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/nyregion/anna-delvey-sorokin.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> The New York Times</span></a>, she intended to defraud the financial institution by creating fake bank statements in Adobe Photoshop, a task that she said took “surprisingly little time.” </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">She’s not alone: image-editing tools like Photoshop are popular among fraudsters because they make it easy to alter information on financial or identity documents like bank statements, utility bills, W-2s and more. Combine that with the fact that fake ID marketplaces and bank statement generators are only a Google (or TikTok) search away, and it’s not hard to see why cases of<a href=""https://www.veriff.com/reports/veriff-2023-identity-fraud-report"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> document fraud rose by 79%</span></a> in 2022.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Mitigating this risk has become more urgent than ever for financial institutions. In recent research that Plaid conducted with more than 400 lending leaders, <a href=""https://www.inscribe.ai/customers/plaid"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">61% say they have experienced document fraud</span></a>—making it the most significant type of fraud they’ve experienced. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">But document fraud can be difficult to detect. Alterations are often nuanced (such as changing the name of a transaction on the fifth page of a 90-day bank statement) and many fraud signals are invisible to the human eye (like details about when the document was last edited, which are hidden in the metadata).  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Thankfully, data from processing millions of documents can shine a light on the most popular document fraud tactics being used by fraudsters today. Keep reading for three trends from the “<a href=""https://www.inscribe.ai/ebook/2023-document-fraud-report"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2023 Document Fraud Trends Report</span></a>” to watch out for this year.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Trend #1: First-party fraud is as prevalent as ever</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">One of the most surprising trends uncovered from reviewing documents in 2022 is that, in many cases, fraudsters actually are who they say they are. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Third-party and synthetic ID fraud have understandably gained a lot of attention over the past few years; synthetic identity fraud, alone, resulted in <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220208005917/en/Federal-Reserve-Releases-Synthetic-Identity-Fraud-Mitigation-Toolkit-to-Educate-Fight-Fraud"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$20 billion in losses</span></a> for U.S. financial institutions in 2020. And according to the <a href=""https://www.veriff.com/reports/veriff-2023-identity-fraud-report"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2023 Identity Fraud Report</span></a>, a little more than half (51%) of all fraud incidents in financial services were categorized as identity fraud (meaning false identity details were used by fraudsters).  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">But what about the other half?  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While many fraudsters are using fake or stolen identities to carry out their schemes, about half (45%) of the fraudulent documents detected did not include alterations to identity details.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Instead, these individuals were using their real identity to engage with a bank, but falsifying information like income, cashflow, bank balance and other financial details to increase their chances of approval or attain larger lines of credit. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In order for organizations to defend against this first-party fraud and credit abuse, they need to have multiple checkpoints for potential customers to pass before they’re granted a loan or line of credit. So just because someone passes an identity document check, it’s critical to still check the legitimacy of any financial documentation they provide as well.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Trend #2: Fake documents have become easier to acquire</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraudsters who need a fake financial document for a credit card or bank account application don’t have to look very hard: bank statement templates, document generators, “novelty” document providers and more are only a few clicks away.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Perhaps even more concerning, many fraudsters have adopted a community mindset, leveraging social media platforms like Reddit, Telegram and TikTok to share techniques, tips and templates for successfully committing document fraud. When a fraudster is able to fool a financial institution with a fake document, they share that document template with others.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In fact, the number of fake or fraudulent document templates being used has skyrocketed in recent years. Last year alone, the number of templates detected tripled, with more than 100 unique templates being flagged in a single week— meaning that more than 100 distinct, unique document templates were identified; the total volume of all document templates detected was often in the thousands for a single week. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If fraudsters are sharing tips and tricks, then fraud investigation teams can too. More and more organizations are creating dedicated spaces (like a Slack channel or wiki) where investigators can pinpoint noteworthy fraud incidents, discuss edge cases or get a second opinion from their other team members on whether something looks like a template they’ve seen before.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Trend 3: Fraudsters are thinking big … and working weekends</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When it comes to which documents fraudsters choose to use when attempting to fly under the radar, you might guess that they’d focus on ones from smaller institutions, like regional banks and credit unions. Since investigators are likely unfamiliar with these institutions, and their financial statements, they would also be less likely to spot a fake. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In reality, that’s not the case. Data shows that the highest fraud rates include documents that claim to be from major financial institutions, like Bank of America, Wells Fargo and TD Bank. And ubiquitous documents like W-2s and CP-575s are also among the most commonly falsified. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another interesting data point uncovered is that the most common days of the week for fraudulent documents to be submitted were Sunday and Saturday, respectively. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What does this mean for your document review process?  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When you come across certain tax documents, bank statements or applications submitted on Sundays, don’t just assume that they’re legitimate because they seem innocuous and familiar. That’s what fraudsters hope you’ll do. Instead, if something feels off or looks suspicious, be sure to flag these documents and give them a closer look.   </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Preventing document fraud in 2023 and beyond</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Eventually, Ms. Sorokin was caught and sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for her crimes, but not before conning banks, hotels and a private jet company out of an estimated $200,000. Her case illustrates how even when fraudsters are caught, it’s often only after they’ve been able to do substantial damage. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Hopefully, sharing these fraud trends helps strategically inform fraud prevention strategies for 2023. When financial institutions arm themselves with knowledge, they can outsmart fraudsters.  </p>

116,<h1>The U.K.’s Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Samuel May,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The U.K.’s Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill made its way through the House of Commons and, more recently, the House of Lords. As the bill approaches becoming law and faces only a few final steps before being law, an analysis of details and slated changes is timely. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">According to the U.K., the bill is supposed to deliver reforms to Companies House (the British executive agency that maintains the register of companies), reforms to prevent the abuse of limited partnerships, additional powers for law enforcement agencies, reforms to give businesses more confidence to share information in order to tackle money laundering and other economic crime and new intelligence gathering powers for law enforcement and removal of nugatory burdens on business. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">For fraud examiners, the bill is host to potentially significant changes to certain operations and functions. Specifically, the bill would: </p>
<ol data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Introduce provisions that could hold corporations criminally liable if they fail to prevent employees or associated persons from committing economic crimes (such as fraud, money laundering or bribery).</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Improve the sharing of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) between financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, ostensibly to enhance detection and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Require additional identity verification for all new and existing registered company directors, people with significant control and individuals who deliver documents to the government.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Grant additional powers to U.K. law enforcement agencies to seize and recover digital assets that are associated with illicit activity (money laundering, fraud and ransomware are specifically mentioned). The House of Lords made changes to include seizing <a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/24/uk-lawmakers-support-easy-seizure-of-crypto-linked-to-terrorist-activity/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">crypto in terrorism cases</span></a>. </li>
</ol>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Perhaps the most interesting of the changes, and potentially the most controversial, is the new “failure to prevent fraud” offence. Organizations will be held liable where a specified fraud offence is committed by an employee or agent, for the organization’s benefit and the organization did not have reasonable fraud prevent procedures in place. The <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-crime-and-corporate-transparency-bill-2022-factsheets/factsheet-failure-to-prevent-fraud-offence"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">U.K. Factsheet</span></a> on this offense specifically states that “it does not need to be demonstrated that company bosses ordered or knew about the fraud.”  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This stands in contrast to the United States promotion of corporate compliance programs and fraud prevention through the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations, which allows for the government to reduce or eliminate punishments for organizations if they follow the guidelines.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Regarding digital assets, the provision relating to the seizure of crypto appears to be just one part of a larger regulatory push by various U.K.  agencies that have produced reports concerning the future of crypto and how the U.K. should move forward in creating new, or implementing existing, regulations to combat illicit use. The U.K., however, still wants to be a “<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/britain-could-see-crypto-regulation-in-12-months-lawmaker-says.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">global hub for cryptoasset technology</span></a>.”  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The new Economic Crime bill builds on a series of other U.K. laws that have been introduced in the past decade. Mentioned specifically by the U.K. Factsheet, this bill follows on the heels of the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) 2022 Act (ECTE). The ECTE focused on sanctions and overseas entities and was a reaction to the global economic results of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Prior to that, the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act, designed to allow the U.K. to issue its own economic sanctions and implement FATF standards, was passed in 2018.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While the full impact of this new law will only be known once law enforcement and prosecutors get the new tools in their hands, the Economic Crime bill could see a significant upheaval in the anti-fraud landscape in the U.K.   </p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">FROM THE PRESIDENT  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Today brings both sadness and joy as the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners bids farewell to outgoing President and CEO Bruce Dorris, who leaves the ACFE to take some time for himself and his family before beginning the next chapter of his career.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I will miss him a great deal, as I’m sure many of you will. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">During Bruce’s tenure, ACFE membership increased to more than 90,000. He guided us through the COVID-19 pandemic at a time when it was not clear what the future of our association, or our profession, would look like. I am proud to say that under his leadership we emerged from the last few years stronger and more stable than ever before.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We owe Bruce a tremendous amount of gratitude for all the time, dedication and energy he has given to the ACFE’s membership and its employees.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">No one person can fill Bruce’s shoes. Due to the tremendous growth of our organization, it makes sense that we now separate the president and chief executive roles.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It is my pleasure to announce that <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/about-the-acfe/staff/bio-john-warren"">John Warren, J.D., CFE</a>, is the ACFE’s new Chief Executive Officer. John formerly served as the ACFE’s Chief Strategy Officer, is a co-author of the ACFE’s Report to the Nations, serves as an advisor of the ACFE Research Institute, sits on the Board of Directors of the ACFE Foundation and remains an advisory member of the ACFE Board of Regents.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I could not be prouder to work with John in leading the ACFE.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If we have not had the pleasure of meeting, I am <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/about-the-acfe/staff/bio-john-gill"">John Gill</a>, and I am honored to be the new President of the ACFE. While I most recently served as the Chief Training Officer, I began my career at the ACFE in 1995 as its first general counsel before transitioning into the research department. Teaching classes all over the U.S. and around the world, many of them alongside Bruce, built a strong sense of dedication to the ACFE and members like you. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Although we are sad that we will no longer be working with Bruce, you can be certain that John Warren and I are excited about these new roles and look forward to continuing the vision of our founder and Chairman Dr. Joseph T. Wells, CFE, CPA, in providing quality service to our members and the best anti-fraud training in the world. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Thank you for your ongoing support, and I look forward to the exciting future that lies ahead. </p>

118,<h1>Protecting the Disabled Community from Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As we commemorate the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it's crucial to reflect on the progress we've made and the challenges that still lie ahead. One such challenge is the prevalence of fraud schemes that <a href=""https://www.neighborsfcu.org/fraud-latest-scams-targeting-people-with-disabilites/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">disproportionately affect the disabled community</span></a>.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Understanding the Threat </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud schemes targeting the disabled community are unfortunately widespread and diverse. They range from identity theft, financial scams, healthcare fraud to disability benefits fraud. These schemes often exploit the vulnerabilities of disabled individuals, such as their reliance on assistance programs or their potential isolation from society. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Identity Theft </strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Identity theft is a common form of fraud that affects many, but it can be particularly devastating for disabled individuals. Disabled individuals are often targeted because they may rely on caregivers or other third parties to manage their finances. Scammers may steal personal information to apply for credit, file taxes or even get medical services. The <a href=""https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-know-about-identity-theft"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Federal Trade Commission</span></a> provides resources on how to protect against identity theft and what to do if you become a victim.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Financial Scams</strong> </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><a href=""https://www.specialneedsalliance.org/the-voice/financial-abuse-of-individuals-with-disabilities/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Financial scams</span></a> often involve tricking disabled individuals into giving away their money or personal information. These scams can take many forms, including lottery scams, romance scams or investment scams. The scammers often prey on the victim's trust and goodwill and take advantage of their financial situations. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Healthcare and Disability Benefits Fraud</strong> </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Healthcare fraud involves the misuse of the healthcare system for financial gain. This can include billing for services not provided, misrepresenting non-covered treatments as necessary medical procedures or prescribing unnecessary medications. Disability benefits fraud involves individuals or organizations falsely claiming disability benefits. It can also involve service providers overcharging for their services or providing unnecessary services to increase their profits. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Your Role as a Certified Fraud Examiner </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As a CFE, you are at the forefront of the battle against fraud schemes that target the disabled community. Your training and expertise in detecting, preventing and investigating fraudulent activities are invaluable. Here's how you can make a difference: </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Detection and Investigation</strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A CFE can play a crucial role in investigating potential disability fraud, thereby safeguarding the resources for the disabled community. You can collaborate with government agencies overseeing disability benefits, work with insurance companies offering disability insurance or even operate as a private consultant for individuals and organizations.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Prevention</strong> </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Your role doesn't stop at detection and investigation. You also have a significant part to play in preventing fraud from happening in the first place. By helping organizations implement effective anti-fraud controls and educating individuals about common fraud schemes, you can help them avoid becoming victims. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Advocacy</strong> </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As a CFE, you are also an advocate for the rights of fraud victims. You can assist victims in reporting the fraud to the appropriate authorities and guide them through the process of recovering their losses. Your support can make a significant difference in their journey towards justice and recovery. </p>

119,<h1>The Evolution of Check Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Around two millennia ago, human civilizations began employing financial mechanisms akin to today's checks. <a href=""https://www.cross-check.com/blog/the-history-of-check-fraud"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Such tools included</span></a> the prescriptions of Ancient Rome, the Adeshas of Ancient India and the letters of credit utilized by Ancient Persians. To circumvent the issues of carrying bulky coin pouches and potential theft, Arab merchants devised the sakk, a paper instrument that facilitated the deposit of money in a bank in one country and its withdrawal in another. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">During the 16th century, cashiers in the Dutch Republic began accepting deposits for a charge and disbursed funds to anyone bearing a note from the depositor. This system expanded across Europe over the ensuing centuries. However, due to all notes being manually inscribed, fraudulent activities were prevalent in the forms of forgery, theft and counterfeiting. This situation was so problematic that many regions prohibited this modern mode of payment. This was later circumvented by the use of unique check paper by financial institutions.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As criminals identified and exploited the system's flaws, the sophistication of check fraud only increased. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As fast as a speeding...horse? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In 1762, <a href=""https://fin.plaid.com/articles/checking-out-a-brief-history-of-checks/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">British banker Lawrence Childs</span></a> pioneered the use of the first printed checks to navigate the issue of forgery and counterfeiting. This inadvertently created opportunities for new forms of check fraud such as check floating, also known as ‘check kiting’, paperhanging and chemical alternation. In instances of check floating, fraudsters would take advantage of the “floating period,” the time between when a check is tendered and when the money is collected by the receiver from the financial institution, using a bad check which will not be cashed as the checking account does not have sufficient funds to cover the payment. At this point in history, the float period was substantially longer as communication between financial institutions was limited by our methods of travel, no faster than a speeding horse. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Checks on acid </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">From the late 1700s to the present, acid has been a societal issue, but not that kind of acid. With the invention of printed checks, scammers would use the chemicals they had on hand, like common household cleaners, to chemically alter checks, “washing” them to remove and then change the payable information. This issue has remained a rampant problem and still has no solution to date; in fact, it is estimated that check washing costs individuals, businesses and financial institutions more than <a href=""https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/wealth/check-washing-scam-how-it-works-ways-to-prevent/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$815 million in losses per year</span></a>. Banks have instituted the use of high security checks to deter fraudsters and it is recommended businesses use a security pen, which has ink that is not dissolvable by the common chemicals used in check washing. However, these are added costs and even if used, they are negated by mobile check depositing.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The creation of MICR </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the mid-20th century, banks recognized the need for a more secure and efficient system to process checks and combat fraud. This led to the development of Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) technology, which significantly reduced check fraud and enhanced efficiency in check processing. MICR, pioneered by Stanford Research Institute and General Electric Computer Laboratory in the 1950s, uses special ink that can be read by machines, encoding vital information like the bank's routing number and the account holder's account number on the check. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The implementation of MICR technology streamlined the check clearing process, making it faster and more accurate, while also providing an additional layer of security against counterfeiting and forgery. The unique magnetic properties of the ink made it difficult to alter or replicate the printed characters, thereby reducing the prevalence of check washing and other forms of chemical alteration. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Check fraud today </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Modern day check fraud involves several common methods. Check kiting, or 'floating checks', still persists. Paperhanging is another prevalent type, where checks are written on closed accounts. Check washing, counterfeiting and forgery, often using sophisticated printing technology, are common, and finally, there's identity theft, where a criminal impersonates the account holder, often obtaining the account holder's checks or even creating counterfeit checks with the victim's account information. Cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly important issue with online banking and digital checks, where hackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information and perform fraudulent activities. Despite all of the advancements in security measures in our modern era and through the long history of check fraud, the creativity and sophistication of fraudsters continue to pose significant challenges. </p>

120,<h1>Updating AML Compliance Programs: Integrating FinCEN’s Priorities</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Adil Raza</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As the landscape of financial crime continues to evolve, financial institutions must stay vigilant and prepared to address emerging risks. In this regard, aligning anti-money laundering (AML) programs with the <a href=""https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-first-national-amlcft-priorities-and-accompanying-statements"">Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</a> (FinCEN) AML Priorities becomes crucial. This article explores the significance of integrating the FinCEN AML Priorities into AML programs and provides step-by-step suggestions to ensure preparedness for regulatory examinations.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Understanding the FinCEN AML Priorities</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The FinCEN AML Priorities serve as a regulatory framework for AML compliance. In its inaugural list issued on June 30, 2021, FinCEN outlined several priorities that financial institutions should consider. These priorities include corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational criminal organization activity, drug trafficking organization activity, human trafficking and human smuggling, and proliferation financing.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Impact of Selected FinCEN AML Priorities</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Corruption</strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As one of the FinCEN priorities, corruption poses significant risks to the integrity of the financial system, undermining fair competition, distorting markets and eroding public trust. Financial institutions must combat corruption as part of their AML programs, as corrupt practices facilitate money laundering, capital flight and illicit financial flows. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Fraud </strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud encompasses a wide range of deceptive practices, including identity theft, money mule schemes and Ponzi schemes. Fraud poses a significant threat to financial institutions, both in terms of financial losses and reputational damage. To mitigate the impact of fraud on financial institutions, AML compliance programs should focus on proactive fraud prevention, early detection and swift response.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) </strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">TCOs engage in various illegal activities, such as drug trafficking, human trafficking and human smuggling, and weapons smuggling. These organizations exploit the global financial system to launder their illicit proceeds. The substantial funds generated from transnational criminal activities can have a distorting effect on local and global economies. Illicit funds infiltrate legitimate sectors, undermining fair competition, market dynamics and investment opportunities. Financial institutions may unknowingly become conduits for transnational criminal activities. Criminal organizations use sophisticated methods to move illicit funds across borders, making it challenging for financial institutions to detect and prevent their involvement. When financial institutions are unwittingly used in money laundering schemes or become victims of fraud perpetrated by transnational criminals, they can suffer financial losses, damage to their reputation, regulatory penalties and legal consequences.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Human trafficking and Human smuggling  </strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Human trafficking and smuggling present grave humanitarian issues with significant financial implications. Human smuggling generates substantial illicit profits that criminals seek to legitimize through money laundering. Financial institutions may inadvertently become channels for laundering these funds, allowing criminals to integrate illegal proceeds into the legitimate economy. Money laundering associated with these activities can lead to reputational damage, regulatory non-compliance and legal repercussions for financial institutions.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Cybercrime </strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Cybercrime refers to criminal activities conducted through digital means, targeting computer systems, networks or individuals for financial gain or disruption. Financial institutions and their customers are prime targets for cyberattacks, which can lead to financial losses, reputational damage and erosion of customer trust.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Integrating FinCEN AML Priorities into AML Programs</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To effectively integrate the FinCEN AML Priorities into AML programs, financial institutions should consider the five key steps outlined below:</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Step 1: Gap Analysis</strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Performing a comprehensive gap analysis is the first step towards preparedness. This analysis evaluates the alignment of existing AML programs with the FinCEN AML Priorities, identifying areas that require improvement or adjustment.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Step 2: Aligning Components of AML Programs</strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Financial institutions should integrate the FinCEN priorities into various components of their AML programs, such as policies and procedures, risk assessment methodologies, customer due diligence processes, transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting protocols. These updates ensure the AML program explicitly addresses the FinCEN AML Priorities and provides guidance to employees for detecting and reporting suspicious activities.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Step 3: Strengthening Governance and Risk Management</strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Senior management should engage actively in aligning AML programs with the FinCEN AML Priorities, providing clear direction and support for implementing necessary changes. Establishing strong governance frameworks, enhancing risk assessment methodologies and highlighting resources and controls based on the identified AML priorities are essential steps in strengthening governance and risk management.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Step 4: Leveraging Technology and Data Analytics</strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Leveraging advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics can optimize AML programs. These technologies enhance the detection and monitoring of suspicious activities related to the FinCEN AML Priorities, identify patterns and anomalies and automate manual processes. Network analytics can aid in uncovering complex relationships and hidden connections, helping identify sophisticated money laundering schemes or fraud networks.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Step 5: Establishing a Continuous Improvement Culture</strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Continuous monitoring, internal audits, independent reviews and promoting communication, training, and awareness among employees is critical to establishing a continuous improvement culture. These efforts ensure the consistent adherence to AML policies and procedures, reinforce the importance of detecting and reporting suspicious activities associated with the FinCEN AML Priorities and provide valuable insights for program enhancement.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Conclusion</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By aligning AML programs with the FinCEN AML Priorities, financial institutions demonstrate their commitment to combating financial crime and promoting a safer and more transparent financial system. Corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational criminal organization activity, human trafficking, smuggling and proliferation financing are all significant concerns that require dedicated attention. Financial institutions that integrate these priorities into their AML programs strengthen their governance frameworks, leverage technology and data analytics and foster a culture of continuous improvement are better prepared to address the evolving risks posed by these priorities and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Aristotelis, with over a decade of experience as an external auditor, has developed a keen interest in understanding the intricacies of fraud detection and assessment. He believes that mentorship is a crucial tool for young professionals aspiring to grow in their careers and has chosen Francesca to guide him on his path to enhancing his professional strategy. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Francesca's fascination with human behavior, complex financial systems and the escalating prevalence of fraudulent activities led her to a career in consulting. She finds great significance in sharing her knowledge and experiences as a mentor, staying connected, and nurturing a symbiotic learning relationship with her mentee, Aristotelis. She views mentoring as a unique opportunity to create a positive impact and is rewarded by witnessing the successful journey of her mentees. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Why was it important for both of you to join the Mentoring Program? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>Aristotelis Konstantinos Koufos</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In my opinion, joining the Mentoring Program is a fundamental step towards completing one’s goals.By this, I am not referring to receiving guidance on how to obtain a professional title only, but growing professionally and obtaining valuable insights regarding the detection and assessment of fraud as well. It is crucial that young people have the chance to learn from experienced professionals -- people that have already encountered similar milestones. These things cannot be found in a manual. Furthermore, the fact that Francesca and I both shared an audit background was one more confirmation that we could ‘communicate’ in the most efficient way and exchange many interesting opinions regarding the field of fraud. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>Francesca Gabella</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Joining the Mentoring Program was important to me as a mentor for a few key reasons. I recognize the significance of giving back and sharing my knowledge and experiences.Being part of a mentoring program allows me to make a positive impact, stay connected and engage in a mutually beneficial learning experience and being able to witness the successful journey of mentees.  </p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">It takes time and research to find the right mentor for one’s specific needs, and the opportunity to gain important guidance (regarding the profession of any kind) does not arise every day. I am very happy I found Francesca’s profile, as she appeared to be, and indeed is, an exceptional mentor who could assist me with the improvement of my strategy to better reach my goal. Moreover, she is the type of person that, unlike family members or friends,  can offer constructive criticism that helps one strengthen their professional areas that need improvement. My professional growth in the field of fraud would have taken longer to achieve without her guidance. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Francesca, how did you know Aristotelis would be the right mentee for your experience and skillset? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>Francesca Gabella</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When I came across Aristotelis as a potential mentee, I was drawn to the fact that we shared a common background in the audit profession and genuine interest in delving deeper into the realm of fraud. This parallel in our backgrounds and our mutual curiosity towards the fraud profession led me to believe that I could offer Aristotelis valuable insights, guidance, and support as he was embarking on his journey towards achieving the CFE certification.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What advice do you both have for anyone who wants to join the ACFE Mentoring Program?   </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>Aristotelis Konstantinos Koufos</em></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Anyone who is interested in joining the mentoring program is highly encouraged to do so, as successful mentorships are founded on boundaries that define social expectations and make one feel safe and goal oriented.

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>Francesca Gabella</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I would encourage anyone who wants to join the mentoring program to embrace the opportunity to expand your professional network, engage in a rewarding two-way learning experience and be a part of a unique and enriching journey! </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What has been the most rewarding part of your journey together?  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>Aristotelis Konstantinos Koufos</em></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">I think that the most important part has been the fact that we both are active listeners to each other’s opinions regarding many different professional areas that are not limited to the field of fraud. Both of us have obtained new insights and have discussed experiences that enrich each professional’s perspective moving forward. In my opinion? The best is yet to come! Thank you, Francesca! </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>Francesca Gabella</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The most rewarding aspect has been the chance to actively listen and learn from one another’s unique perspectives, engaging in open and honest conversations that have provided valuable insights and alternative perspectives. Witnessing Aristotelis’ proactive approach in pursuing and successfully achieving the CFE certification has been particularly gratifying! </p>

I am fascinated by trying to understand the opportunity and rationalization of the fraudster.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you get to your current role?  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">My career journey started with a simple “yes” to a role that I never considered.

I have worked in both the public and private sectors, which has helped me gain valuable experience and understand the unique challenges of each. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">With my background and experience, I landed my current role seeking a new challenge and opportunity.  I work for a mid-size biotech Oncology company, which is experiencing significant growth over the last several years.  With rapid growth and success from a company always comes an increase in risk, it is my role to help ensure that the right controls and oversight is in place to help minimize risk and ensure that we are compliant with laws and regulations. </p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Never stop learning. I am always looking for opportunities to gain experience and develop both personally and professionally.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Never assume! While your mind is always trying to look for ways to make things make sense, every investigation has a unique set of individuals associated with the case, and each case is different. It’s hard to fight your intuitions, but there is a lot to be gained by being open and letting the facts take you through the case. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is important to you about being a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE)? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Being a part of a group with individuals who are enthusiastic about fighting fraud and being a CFE provides a place to be able to leverage various different skill sets and backgrounds has been extremely valuable in my career.

124,<h1>Fraud Perspectives: Nonfungible Tokens</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Kate Pospisil,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>In the third webinar of the Fraud Perspectives series, presented by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) and The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), Mason Wilder, Research Manager at the ACFE, chatted with Kishan Patel, CIA, CITP, CPA, and Chris DeAngelis, CFE, about nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and their role in the current anti-fraud landscape. A confusing and often abstract concept, NFTs have made headlines recently as an innovative new technology with the potential to revolutionize various industries. While NFTs offer numerous benefits, such as increased security and unique ownership, they also present new fraud risks. Understanding these risks and how to mitigate them is essential for organizations that are considering investing in NFTs. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is an NFT? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">NFTs are assets that have been tokenized via a blockchain, and these digital, programmable transactions on the blockchain allow anyone to see the transaction flow. Following the digitization of many aspects of our daily lives, NFTs offer a way to tokenize anything of economic value, including branding and marketing, loyalty and rewards programs, event tickets and passes, identity and access management, data management and more. NFTs are considered more of a collectible asset than a security, and anything that can be put into a smart contract can be used for NFTs. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud Risks Associated with NFTs </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Several primary fraud risks are associated with NFTs, including money laundering, fake or counterfeit NFTs, intellectual property theft, shilling (multiple parties colluding to pretend interest to drive price) and cyber theft in general. Additionally, the burden of proof on art ownership is low, making it difficult to authenticate and prevent theft. Furthermore, rug pulls and airdrop scams are two common NFT-specific schemes that raise a new set of challenges for both auditors and fraud examiners. Rug pulls involve developers hyping a project to attract investors, then the scammer disappears with the invested funds. Air drop scams involve the promotion of a user receiving an exclusive NFT drop that requires them to connect their digital wallet, which is then drained. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">One of the main challenges of NFTs for auditors and fraud examiners is how to assess their value on a balance sheet. Experts suggest looking at comparable assets in the marketplace, contract history, the price people are willing to pay, rarity of the asset and whether an NFT has held its value since its original purchase. Without regulatory guidance, it is difficult to determine the actual value of an NFT. Additionally, the vast array of applications for NFTs makes it challenging to define regulatory guidance. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Despite their perceived security with transaction histories available on a public blockchain, both Patel and DeAngelis agree that the potential for fraud risks is always present when dealing with NFTs. According to DeAngelis, “It’s hard to define something at the beginning of its lifecycle as truly good or truly bad … if there’s a way to use it [badly], it’s probably going to happen.” Patel added, “Permissionless, trustless technology … will always be susceptible to bad actors.”  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Controls and Best Practices </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The volatility of cryptocurrency is a significant red flag that may indicate that an NFT is being overvalued. Auditors should verify how the value is being claimed and whether that value has held, increased or dropped over time. A further cause for concern is the lack of required control, cooperation and compliance regulations, which make NFTs susceptible to many forms of manipulation. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Implementing standard best practices is a critical step in controlling NFT fraud risks. Good know-your-customer (KYC) practices, continuous monitoring of digital wallets and regular digital wallet hygiene are essential controls to mitigate fraud risks. An extra layer of identification in the creation of a wallet, such as multi-factor authorization, and transacting in a safe environment is highly recommended.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Future of NFTs </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Entering the NFT space from a fraud-fighting perspective requires a foundation of understanding from blockchain to crypto to NFTs. To get started, consider taking blockchain courses, understanding smart contracts, picking up coding skills (especially Python) and building a foundation of understanding — you need a solid beginning to successfully advance in an evolving NFT environment. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">New experts are emerging who have gone through specific training to help auditors navigate NFTs and blockchain technology. For instance, ""<a href=""https://knowyourmeme.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Know Your Meme</span></a>"" uses proprietary tools and investigations to determine the creators of memes, which can help prevent intellectual theft. Determining the underlying currency that supports an NFT and monitoring the lifecycle of the NFT itself (collectible or art) can also aid auditors in navigating the NFT space. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">NFTs have numerous potential current and future use cases, including branding and marketing, loyalty programs, customer engagement with ""techiness,"" commercial and mainstream applications, and the increase of digital money becoming the norm. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In conclusion, while NFTs might ebb and flow in use cases moving forward, as they have since their inception, they also present a unique set of fraud risks that organizations, auditors and fraud examiners must be aware of. </p>

125,<h1>Financial Literacy for a Better Tomorrow</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Khaliff Haned</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">In this article, I want to share something very important: financial literacy. According to the <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Wiley Online Library</span></a>, “Financial literacy is the ability to use knowledge and skills to manage financial resources effectively for a lifetime of financial well-being."" Sounds pretty useful, right? But how do we learn financial literacy? And when should we start? </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">I believe that financial literacy must be taught by parents at home and not too often rewarding children with materials as it will create the mentality of ""What do I get in return” for everything they do. Also, financial literacy must be thought in school starting from a young age as it will cultivate a healthy mind and energy. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Let me explain. First, parents are the role models for their children especially when it comes to money matters. Children observe how their parents spend, save and budget money every day. They also learn from their parents' attitudes and emotions about money. If parents are stressed, anxious or secretive about money, children may pick up on those feelings and develop unhealthy money habits — or worse, develop a fraudster in the making. On the other hand, if parents are open, confident and responsible with money, children may learn to be the same. That's why I think parents should practice learning at home by involving them in financial conversations, sharing positive stories, giving them an allowance and guiding them to set financial goals. Parents should also avoid rewarding their children with materials every time they do something good because that can create a sense of entitlement and dependence on external rewards, which can lead to corruption. Instead, parents should praise their children for their efforts and achievements, and teach them the value of hard work, gratitude and generosity. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Secondly, I think financial literacy should be implemented starting at pre-school in so many fun and interactive ways, like creating a simple song or jingle or via storytelling because children's brains are more receptive and adaptable at that stage. Research shows that financial education can have a positive impact on a student's financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. Financial education can also help students develop critical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making skills that are essential for life. That's why I think schools should offer simple, fun modules and interactive activities to teach students about basic financial concepts such as income, expenses, savings, investments, credit, debt, taxes and insurance. Schools should also provide opportunities for students to apply their financial skills in real-life situations, such as setting up a lemonade stand, selling cookies or managing a classroom budget. Schools should also encourage students to take part in financial literacy competitions or clubs where they can learn from their peers and mentors. Thus, they are growing up positively as an individual and professionals with integrity. </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">By teaching financial literacy at home and in school starting from a young age, we can equip our young leaders with the tools and mindset they need to face and overcome the challenges ahead. Financial literacy can help them achieve their personal and professional goals, prepare for emergencies and contribute to society. Financial literacy can also help them live happier and healthier lives. </p>

126,<h1>Forensic Approach to Reel Off Diversion of the Institutional Product to Local Markets</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Anuj Choudhary,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated due to its impact on public health. Despite strict regulations in India, drug diversion to the normal market remains a persistent problem, compromising patient safety and industry credibility. Diversion refers to the sale of pharmaceutical products outside authorized channels, resulting in unsafe or counterfeit products entering the market. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Recently, the management of a multinational pharmaceutical company operating in more than 20 countries worldwide approached us. The company has a significant presence in India, with central and forwarding centers (CFCs) in over eight states to cater to its vast customer base. Some of the CFCs are designated to supply institutional products to medical institutions, government hospitals and other such institutions, while others are responsible for retail products, over-the-counter supplies and more. The company's management was concerned that some of its institutional products were finding their way into the normal market, and they engaged our team to identify any irregularities or fraudulent activities in their supply chain. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We designed our scope of review which included a comprehensive examination of the entire supply chain process, including inventory management at the factory, warehouse and CFCs, as well as distribution procedure, personnel management and sales practices. To uncover practices happening on the ground, we also included covert procedures, which involved observing the actions of distributors, retailers and wholesalers suspected of diverting institutional products. We tracked the serial numbers and batch codes to ascertain the route taken by the product from the factory to the point of diversion. We also conducted a market survey by interacting with end customers to understand their perspectives on the sourcing places. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Based on the scope mentioned, the following procedures were conducted for identifying diversion of institutional products to local markets: </p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Comprehensive review of the supply chain process</strong>: This involved examining the entire supply chain process, including inventory management at the factory, warehouse and CFCs, as well as distribution procedures, personnel management and sales practices.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Covert procedures</strong>: To observe the actions of distributors, retailers and wholesalers suspected of diverting institutional products, we employed covert procedures such as conducting secret surveillance, mystery shopping and conducting investigations in a discreet manner.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Serial number and batch code tracking</strong>: By tracking the serial numbers and batch codes of institutional products, we were able to determine the route taken by the product from the factory to the point of diversion.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Market survey</strong>: Conducting a market survey involved interacting with end customers to understand their perspectives on the sourcing places.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Identify irregularities or fraudulent activities</strong>: During the comprehensive review of the supply chain process, we looked for any irregularities or fraudulent activities, such as missing inventory records or discrepancies between the number of institutional products produced and the amount sold through authorized channels. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Analyze inventory records</strong>: By analyzing inventory records, we were able to identify any discrepancies between the number of institutional products produced and the amount sold through authorized channels.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Interview personnel</strong>: We interviewed personnel involved in the supply chain process to gain insights into their practices and identify any potential red flags.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Cross-check invoices</strong>: By cross-checking the invoices of distributors, wholesalers and retailers with the product serial numbers and batch codes, we were able to verify the legitimacy of the products and the supply chain process.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Surprise inspections</strong>: Surprise inspections of warehouses, CFCs and retail outlets were conducted to identify any diversion of institutional products to local markets.  </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Based on the exercise, the following fraud observations were identified: </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A comprehensive review of the supply chain process was conducted to identify potential weak points in the system allowing institutional products to be diverted to the local market. Covert procedures were employed, such as conducting secret surveillance, mystery shopping and discreet investigations to gather evidence without alerting suspected parties. Serial number and batch code tracking helped identify the exact location and parties involved in the diversion. Market surveys were conducted to understand customers' perspectives on sourcing places. Irregularities and fraudulent activities such as missing inventory records or discrepancies between production and sales were investigated. Personnel involved in the supply chain process were interviewed, invoices were cross-checked, and surprise inspections were conducted to prevent the diversion of institutional products. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Our learnings from the above case: </p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Conducting a comprehensive review of the entire supply chain process is essential to identify potential weak points in the system that could allow institutional products to be diverted to the local market. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Covert procedures such as secret surveillance, mystery shopping and discreet investigations can help gather evidence without alerting suspected parties. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Tracking serial numbers and batch codes can help identify the exact location and parties involved in the diversion of institutional products. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Conducting market surveys can help understand customers' perspectives on sourcing places and identify any suspicious or unauthorized sources of institutional products. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Conducting surprise inspections of warehouses, CFCs and retail outlets can help prevent the diversion of institutional products and gather evidence. </li>

127,<h1>Uncovering Financial Mismanagement: A Case of Investment Risks and Investigation</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Anuj Choudhary,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Investing in any business can be a risk, and unfortunately, some investors fall victim to fraudulent schemes. We helped a group of investors who had invested USD $100 million in an educational institution providing coaching services for competitive examinations. The investors were concerned about the institution's operations and suspected that their funds were being misused. Our team of experts took on the case, employing a range of techniques and procedures to uncover the truth.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">The institution had raised USD $100 million from a group of investors nearly half a decade prior to our involvement. The investors were facing issues related to revenue and collections, as well as investments made by the institution. The institute was providing coaching to students appearing for competitive examinations.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Our team's first task was to address the issue related to revenue and collections. We found that the institution was not recording cash collections properly, and excess money was being diverted to the promoters and management under the guise of discounts. We discovered several discrepancies between the student collection data and bank statements, leading us to suspect that cash collections were being underreported. Additionally, the institution had a long list of debtors who had not paid their dues for more than four years.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">We conducted a thorough analysis of the institution's revenue and collections practices and discovered numerous irregularities and fraudulent activities. To further investigate, we utilized Benford's Law to analyze the distribution of first digits in cash collections records, which allowed us to identify any anomalies or deviations from the expected pattern. Our procedures revealed significant discrepancies in the institution's revenue and collections practices. We recommended implementing better collection practices, establishing appropriate approval protocols for discounts, and conducting regular financial audits to ensure compliance with policies and regulations.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">The second issue was related to investments made by the institution. The investors were concerned about the inter-corporate loans that the institution had extended to a few entities, including individuals who were not servicing their loans properly. They were also worried about the USD $15 million invested by the institution in the form of the acquisition of subsidiaries, which turned out to be futile.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Our team initiated transaction testing procedures to investigate this matter, reviewing the loan agreements and investment documents to identify any potential irregularities or violations of policies and procedures. We conducted a detailed review of the loan and investment transactions, including the flow of funds, to identify any suspicious or unusual activity. Additionally, we gathered information through open- desktop searches/public domain searches to learn more about the borrowers of the inter-corporate loans and the subsidiaries that the institution had acquired.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">Our investigation revealed that the promoter of the institution had entered into related party transactions with his past students in the form of inter-corporate loans to their paper companies. These transactions had not been disclosed to the investors, and the money was being siphoned off for personal gain. We presented our findings to the investors, and legal action was taken against the promoters and management. The investors were able to recover a significant portion of their funds.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">This case highlights the importance of conducting thorough investigations when there are suspicions of fraudulent activities. Our team of experts employed a range of techniques and procedures to uncover the truth and helped the investors recover their hard-earned money. We were committed to using our expertise to ensure that businesses operate ethically and transparently, providing our clients with the peace of mind they deserve.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;white-space: normal !important;white-space:pre-wrap;"">In conclusion, our team's comprehensive analysis and diligent investigative procedures were crucial in identifying irregularities and fraudulent activities in the educational institution's revenue and collections practices, as well as uncovering related party transactions and mismanagement of investments. Our findings helped the investors make informed decisions and take corrective actions to improve the institution's financial management and also mitigate future risks.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Our learnings from this case:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Conducting thorough investigations is crucial in identifying irregularities and fraudulent activities.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Due diligence should be conducted before investing money in any scheme to mitigate risks.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Having a robust internal control system in place can prevent fraudulent activities.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Proper recording of revenue and collections practices is essential to avoid financial mismanagement.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Transparent disclosure of related party transactions is necessary to maintain ethical business practices.</li>

128,<h1>Falsifying Business Records: Federal Regulations and State Laws</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Laura Harris,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Federal law does not explicitly criminalize falsifying business records, but the act is criminalized under several federal regulations. Additionally, many states consider it a crime and sometimes prosecute it with other crimes, such as grand larceny or insurance fraud. In New York, falsifying business records is not an uncommon charge and can be either a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the circumstances. The aggravating circumstance occurs when the “intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof.” One example of this is changing a record to cover larceny.   </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Often with fraud cases, the <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/fraud-examiner-archives/fraud-examiner-article?s=whats-intent-got-to-do-with-it"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">intent</span></a> to defraud can be a harder element to prove over unintended error. Moreover, New York law also provides for an affirmative defense for clerks, bookkeepers or other employees who merely executed the orders of their supervisors without personal benefit to themselves. Intent to defraud in the case of falsifying business records <a href=""https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/175.05"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">means</span></a>: </p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Making or causing a false entry in the business records of an enterprise; or </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Altering, erasing, obliterating, deleting, removing or destroying a true entry in the business records of an enterprise; or</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Preventing the making of a true entry or causing the omission of one in the business records of an enterprise. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">One well-publicized case involving falsifying business records in the first degree is that of Tyco International former leadership. In 2005, Leo Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz, CEO and CFO respectively, directed others to falsify Tyco’s books to conceal their secret compensation. They managed this by offsetting the costs through various means, such as relocating a loan forgiveness against the gain from an unrelated IPO of a Tyco subsidiary, against an unrelated gain realized on the disposal of a Tyco subsidiary, and against an unrelated gain on the sale of common stock of a Tyco subsidiary. The latter two included executive compensation that was never disclosed and contrary to the requirements of the federal securities laws. Kozlowski and Swartz were sentenced to terms of 8 1/3 to 25 years and fined $134 million for their roles in the Tyco fraud. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another infamous New York case involving falsifying business records belongs to Steven Croman, a notorious ”<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/nyregion/steven-croman-landlord-pleads-guilty-to-fraud.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Bernie Madoff of landlords</span></a>” and real estate mogul.  In 2017, Croman owned more than 150 buildings in Manhattan and pleaded guilty to grand larceny, fraudulently refinancing $45 million worth of loans and committing tax fraud; Croman served one year in jail, and as part of his guilty plea, he also agreed to a $5 million tax settlement. Rarely are landlords sentenced to jail for infractions, which underscores the severity of Croman’s crimes. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">However, New York has also <a href=""https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/survey-new-york-felony-falsification-of-business-records-just-security.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">prosecuted</span></a> the felony in many smaller ways. In two unrelated cases, women were indicted for fraud for using or selling phony coronavirus vaccination cards. Another case involved a Hurricane Sandy relief worker submitting fake applications for over $200,000 worth of disaster money and used for personal expenses. A few cases addressed falsified information in a Department of Corrections use of force report forms when correction officers covered up assaults on an inmate, while other cases include a false arrest over parking and deliberate misinformation on a food stamp application.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud examiners understand the importance of recognizing falsified business documents: Documents that should match, but don’t, should be investigated. CFEs should remain especially observant when it comes to analyzing manual records. Handwriting on its own is not necessarily a red flag, as many organizations may have need to manually fill out forms, but handwriting may indicate a batch or bulk processing of items that should have been completed over a different timeframe. Other potential red flags may include missing source documents, unusual amount of out-of-sequence check numbers or duplicate invoice numbers.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Falsified business documents can be an indication of a larger fraud, even if the falsification is considered small. Just an adjustment to the wording of an entry or the difference of timing can cause changes that misrepresent an organization’s position. Even with the best intent, falsifying does more harm than good. Business documents and records serve a purpose and must be kept accurately.    </p>

130,<h1>Antwerp’s Diamond Trade: A Brilliant Tale of Risky Business Practices</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Clarisse Persia, CFE</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Secretive and exclusive, Antwerp has been the heart of the global diamond trade since the 15th century when the Belgian city was the commercial heart of Europe, with 40% of world trade crossing its ports via old trade routes connecting Venice to Lisbon. According to the <a href=""https://www.awdc.be/en/diamond-trade-and-industry"">Antwerp World Diamond Center</a> (AWDC), about 1,700 companies and 4,500 traders concentrated in an area of about one square kilometer trade <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/belgium-trade-russian-diamonds-despite-moral-pressure"">84% of all rough diamonds worldwide</a>. Although facing competition from India and the Middle East, Antwerp’s multi-million-dollar deals are still concluded with a handshake and the Yiddish words <em>“mazel und broche” </em>(“luck and blessing”). Are we certain diamonds are a blessing for all?</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Tax Avoidance</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Files obtained in the Swiss Leaks by French newspaper Le Monde and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that, in the early 2000s, HSBC’s Swiss unit helped 2,000 diamond traders avoid taxes by shielding their assets. In 2014, a Belgian prosecutor charged HSBC's Swiss unit with fraud, money laundering and criminal conspiracy for advising its clients — mostly in the diamond industry — to set up offshore accounts in Panama and the British Virgin Islands to hide their assets from taxes. A few of these <a href=""https://www.icij.org/investigations/swiss-leaks/diamond-dealers-deep-trouble-bank-documents-shine-light-secret-ways/"">HSBC diamond clients</a>, including Richard Davidovici, Kenneth Lee Akselrod and Mozes Victor Konig, were already <a href=""https://www.icij.org/investigations/swiss-leaks/banking-giant-hsbc-sheltered-murky-cash-linked-dictators-and-arms-dealers/"">wanted by Interpol</a> for financial crimes in Russia. In January 2021, <a href=""https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/belgium-all-news/150503/money-laundering-in-diamond-sector-major-trial-starts-today-antwerp-hsbc-switzerland"">The Brussels Times</a><em> </em>reported that a trial began involving 14 unnamed persons accused of laundering diamonds profits to avoid paying taxes.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Conflict Diamonds</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Between the 1990s and 2000s, Antwerp hosted high-profile cases involving the smuggling of conflict diamonds that fueled civil wars in Africa. The world’s first trial involving conflict diamonds was held before Antwerp’s Criminal Court in 2004, which involved an investigation into the Nassour and Ahmad families for smuggling conflict diamonds from Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Antwerp. Diamond dealer Aziz Nassour was sentenced to six years in prison, and their Belgian company Asa Diam <a href=""https://ipisresearch.be/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Belgiums-fight-against-conflict-diamonds.pdf"">was ordered to pay a customs fine</a> for not declaring diamonds. <a href=""https://www.icij.org/investigations/swiss-leaks/diamond-dealers-deep-trouble-bank-documents-shine-light-secret-ways/"">The Swiss Leaks</a> also reported about Omega Diamonds BV that agreed to pay a USD 195 million civil settlement in 2013, after a former employee blew the whistle about the company laundering arms money.</p>
<h2>Terrorism Financing </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">After the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States, <a href=""https://ipisresearch.be/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Belgiums-fight-against-conflict-diamonds.pdf"">accusations of terrorist financing through the diamond trade</a> was added to the ones relating to the trade in conflict diamonds. According to a <a href=""https://rusi.org/publication/role-conflict-diamonds-and-failed-states-terrorist-financial-structure"">2007 report by the think tank RUSI</a>, al-Qaeda managed to establish a diamond trading post centered in Liberia, which also controlled diamonds mined in Sierra Leone, while Hezbollah operated predominantly in the Ivory Coast. In 2004, Nassour and his cousin, Samih Ossailly, were also charged for financing al-Qaeda, but these charges were deemed unfounded by <a href=""https://ipisresearch.be/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Belgiums-fight-against-conflict-diamonds.pdf"">Antwerp’s Criminal Court</a>.

<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Sanctions on Russian Diamonds</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Amid the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/major-jewellers-to-cease-buying-russian-origin-diamonds-after-increased-scrutiny"">news sources reported</a> that jewelers including Tiffany, Richemont and Signet pledged not to buy Russian diamonds — even if they were transformed outside of the country. Despite the war in Ukraine, official Belgian statistics showed that Belgium still imported EUR 676 million worth of Russian diamonds in the second quarter of 2022. Resistance from Antwerp has been perceived as the main reason for the EU’s backtracking when approving an import ban from Russian state-owned diamond producer Alrosa in October 2022. In January 2023, the <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/8b8e289a-ffc7-44b3-b145-8cb24e3eef7e"">Financial Times</a> reported that introducing sanctions could cost 10,000 jobs and that other countries were ready to profit, according to AWDC.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Regulatory Framework and Emerging Risk</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">According to a <a href=""https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf/documents/reports/ML-TF-through-trade-in-diamonds.pdf"">2013 FATF report</a>, diamonds are a risky business due to their multi-jurisdictional trade routes, tracing difficulties and their high liquidity.

It is to be seen if these regulations can shield Antwerp’s diamond traders from the city’s rising reputation as Europe’s “<a href=""https://www.dw.com/en/cocaine-capital-antwerp-fears-drug-related-attacks-may-rise/a-64555178"">Cocaine capital</a>.” In 2020, <a href=""https://www.tijd.be/politiek-economie/belgie/economie/drugsgeld-witgewassen-via-antwerpse-diamantairs/10200139.html"">operation “Cash Travel”</a> revealed how vulnerable the diamond industry is to drug cartels.</p>

131,<h1>Investigating Fraud in Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs)</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Anuj Choudhary,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) provide free or low-cost medications to eligible patients who cannot afford them. Despite regulatory oversight, instances of PAP fraud have been reported globally. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Recently, our team was approached by a multinational pharmaceutical company in India to investigate allegations of PAP fraud. Our task was to identify any irregularities or fraudulent activities in the company's PAP program and provide recommendations to improve the program's integrity. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The pharmaceutical company under investigation is a global player in the healthcare industry with a presence in over 100 countries. The company's PAP program is a crucial component of the company's corporate social responsibility, and any irregularities or fraudulent activities could tarnish the company's reputation.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We started our review by scoping the entire project, which included a thorough review of company's PAP policies and procedures to gain a comprehensive understanding of the program's operations. We conducted interviews with sample program administrators, healthcare providers and patients to identify any areas of concern. Then we thoroughly reviewed contracts and conducted a holistic process walkthrough to understand each phase of a transaction. We used forensic tools, such as data analytics, to review the access control data of ERP and shared folder data, billing / supplies data, data relating to spends etc., to identify any irregularities in the program's operations and provide the company with the insights and recommendations thereby. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Our investigation focused on 10 key areas, including eligibility criteria, patient enrolment process, drug dispensation, financial transactions and compliance with regulatory requirements. We began our investigation by gathering all the relevant documents, including the PAP policies, contracts and communication records between the company and healthcare professionals. We then conducted interviews with several key personnel involved in the PAP process, including the PAP coordinators, marketing team members and healthcare professionals who had received PAP benefits. During the interviews, we asked specific questions to understand the PAP process and any potential discrepancies. We also analyzed the financial transactions related to PAP benefits and cross-checked them with the company's financial records. We used forensic tools to identify any suspicious transactions or anomalies. The procedures we performed helped us identify multiple instances of PAP fraud and provided us with evidence to back up our findings.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Our investigation revealed several irregularities in the company's PAP program, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">PAP funds were being used as incentive to influence the prescribing habits of healthcare providers.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">PAP funds were being misused to influence government officials and healthcare regulators.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The PAP program did not have a tracking system to monitor the outcomes of financial assistance provided to patients, so the program had no way of assessing whether financial assistance was reaching the intended beneficiaries or whether it was having a positive impact on their health outcomes. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The PAP program did not monitor whether the beneficiaries were requiring the assistance anymore, i.e., if the patient had passed away or if the patient had recovered from the ailment prompting assistance.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Eligibility for the PAP program was not clearly defined. As a result, some ineligible patients were enrolled in the program, and some eligible patients were excluded. Further, this also created confusion among patients and healthcare providers.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The application process for the program was incomplete and did not include all the necessary documentation, which caused delays in processing.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The company's IT systems were vulnerable to fraud. The absence of adequate security measures made the systems susceptible to hacking and data breaches.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The program was poorly administered with inadequate staffing and training for program administrators. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Our investigation highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity of PAP programs. PAPs are essential resources for patients who cannot afford their medications, and any fraudulent activities can deprive eligible patients of this vital service. Our forensic approach, which included data analytics and financial audits, enabled us to identify irregularities in the company's PAP program and provide recommendations to improve its integrity. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Our Learnings from the above case:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">PAP programs aid patients unable to afford medication, but global fraud cases have arisen.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To identify irregularities and fraud, review policies, conduct walkthroughs, conduct interviews and use forensic tools like data analytics.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Assess PAP program integrity by investigating eligibility criteria, patient enrolment, drug dispensation, financial transactions and regulatory compliance.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">PAP fraud deprives eligible patients and underscores the need for forensic investigations to prevent fraud and maintain program integrity.</li>

132,<h1>Leading the Way on Recovering the Proceeds of Corruption</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Martin Kenney </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The head of Peru's judiciary, Javier Arévalo Vela, recently publicly highlighted Peru's success in recovering the proceeds of corruption and related financial crimes through its non-conviction based forfeiture law, <em>Extinción de Dominio</em>.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The subsystem Peru has rolled out to implement the law “allows the state to recover money from cases of corruption, money laundering and more,” Vela said <a href=""https://baselgovernance.org/news/judges-convention-shows-why-peru-leader-recovering-proceeds-corruption-through-non-conviction"">at a recent conference</a> run by the Swiss organization, the <a href=""https://baselgovernance.org/"">Basel Institute on Governance</a>. Around $64 million has already been recovered, with many more cases in the pipeline.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This all highlights the inroads Peru is making into fighting corruption through non-conviction based forfeiture. Many developed states have similar laws designed to frustrate those who would pilfer the public purse, but there will be others wondering if such legislation is advantageous, if it does not already exist: the answer should be a resounding “yes.”</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Legislation of this type removes the need for lengthy and expensive criminal investigations that will likely fizzle out, leaving the wrongdoer to hang onto illicit gains. By implementing a process using the civil-law burden of proof, the state can right the wrong and ensure that crime does not pay.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There may be those who find this premise draconian and unfair, who see such a process as being in conflict with human rights and open to abuse. If you have significant wealth and assets, it should be straightforward to account for these if asked to do so. It’s unlikely that you can be a civil servant earning $60k per annum and have a private yacht berthed off Monaco; however, if you do, then you should be able to evidence the derivation of this wealth.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">However, the concern that there is the potential for abuse of process by a rogue state is also valid. History is littered with examples of political opponents falling foul of those in power and being stripped of their assets. The question is, then, do we rule out such powers for the many on the basis that a few may abuse them?</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There is no easy answer to this quandary. My perspective is that a rogue state will <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/23/peru-former-president-alejandro-toledo-arrives-to-face-corruption-charges?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other"">abuse its citizens and political opponents</a> regardless of whether there is a law in place allowing non-conviction based forfeiture. However, those countries with the willingness to embrace the notion that corruption is wrong and that it needs addressing can be guided in developing legislation that fits the bill and, as importantly, shown how these powers need to be wielded fairly and justly.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Therefore, the Basel Institute and its partners should be congratulated on their efforts, as must the Peruvian government and judiciary who are embracing change and making a difference on behalf of their people.</p>

133,<h1>Fraud Talk: The Art and Ethics of Social Engineering</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In this episode, Jenny Radcliffe, aka ""The People Hacker,"" discusses her expertise as an ethical social engineer, honing those skills at an early age on the streets of Liverpool, and unique challenges she has faced over the years. Joining ACFE Community Manager Rihonna Scoggins during Women's History Month, Radcliffe explains how being a woman in her field and gender biases she has observed played a significant role in understanding the ""human element"" behind social engineering. Her new book ""People Hacker: Confessions of a Burglar for Hire"" is available now in the U.K.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>In the excerpt below from <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/podcast/podcast-detail?s=march-2023-the-art-and-ethics-of-social-engineering"">episode 130</a>, Radcliffe talks with Scoggins about how she conducts her work as a “people hacker”.</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Rihonna Scoggins</strong>: I'm really looking forward to our conversation today. Your experience is really interesting, to say the least. Now you're at this point where you've spoken at many events, and for different companies, and some of our own members may even recognize your voice from our anti-fraud leadership summit that we had last year. Can you tell us a bit about your unconventional experience that led you to where you are now, giving talks, authoring books, and helping companies?</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Jenny Radcliffe</strong>: Sure. Within the security industry, social engineering is not such an unusual job. Although a lot of the time people will do the same job to me use technology. Social engineering is all about hacking a company at their request. At least when you do it actively like I do, at their request. It's a cross between a fire drill and Oceans 11, but we're not that good-looking.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We put together a team, I put together a team, sometimes I work on my own, in order to test the human side of a business' security. That would be everything from whether people follow the rules, or whether we let people tailgate through gates and reception, whether we give our details away or information away through phishing e-mail or phone calls.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Also, what I do that's not as well known is we actually break into buildings. We actually do our best to bypass security, to get into a site, and work our way around that site to find out, sometimes we have a target from the client but sometimes it's just generally, are there any things that I might see that I think could be a security risk. Then it's an education piece, we report back to the client, and we help them fix those issues so that the real criminals can't do it for real.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I guess this is a job that I've done in the open for maybe 15 years, but all my life really, and that's because nobody really spoke about this until cyber became a thing and the internet became a thing, and you realize that there was more people than just me who did this.</p>

134,<h1>The Unseen Dangers of Influencer Fraud: A Growing Concern in the Digital Age</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the ever-evolving landscape of the digital world, influencer marketing has taken center stage as a powerful tool for brands and businesses to reach their target audience. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and as the industry continues to grow, so does the potential for fraud. Let's delve into the world of influencer fraud and explore its many faces, consequences and potential solutions. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Illusion of Popularity </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">One of the most common types of influencer fraud is the purchase of fake followers, likes and engagement to create the illusion of popularity. With a plethora of services available that sell these fraudulent metrics, it's become increasingly challenging for brands to discern genuine influencers from those bolstering their numbers artificially. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This manipulation of social proof not only dupes brands into partnering with less effective influencers, but it also undermines the integrity of the influencer marketing industry as a whole. Consequently, businesses may see diminished returns on investment, with a portion of their advertising dollars wasted on campaigns that fail to reach real consumers. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Slippery Slope of Dishonest Disclosure </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another insidious form of influencer fraud is the failure to disclose sponsored content properly. Influencers are legally required to disclose paid partnerships, per the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines. However, some influencers skirt these rules, deliberately deceiving their followers and misrepresenting their relationship with the brands they promote. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This lack of transparency can damage consumer trust, tarnish brand reputations, and even result in legal consequences for both influencers and the companies they represent. More importantly, it fosters an environment where dishonesty thrives, ultimately detracting from the credibility of the influencer marketing space. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Combating Influencer Fraud </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As the industry grapples with these challenges, it's crucial for businesses and influencers alike to prioritize transparency and authenticity in their partnerships. Companies should take a proactive approach to vetting potential influencers and look beyond surface-level metrics like follower count and engagement rates. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Tools like social media analytics platforms can help identify and analyze organic growth patterns, while thorough background checks can reveal any red flags, such as past fraudulent activities. Additionally, brands should establish clear guidelines for influencer partnerships, including expectations for disclosure and communication with followers. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Influencer fraud is a growing concern in the digital age, but it doesn't have to spell doom for the industry. By fostering a culture of transparency, authenticity and due diligence, brands, influencers and consumers alike can work together to combat fraud and preserve the value of influencer marketing. </p>

135,<h1>Behind the Hype: The Unhealthy Reality of Health MLMs</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Kate Pospisil,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Multi-level marketing (MLM) companies have been around for decades, but they have recently gained popularity in the health and wellness industry. You’ve seen these companies promoting on social media, like the ubiquitous “Hey hun!” in your Facebook Messenger, or perhaps even approaching you in public squares and asking to join their “exclusive” club, buy their product or join their workout group. Keywords and phrases can include: “detox” (you have a liver and kidneys for that), “lose weight fast” (diet, exercise and your doctor are your best bets here), or the worst, “cure your [ailment] with a simple supplement.”  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">These multi-level marketers promise to help people achieve their health goals while providing a business opportunity to those who join. However, many of these companies have been accused of fraud, making false health claims and preying on vulnerable populations. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Firstly, it's essential to understand how MLMs work. MLMs are a type of direct selling where independent contractors sell products to customers and recruit others to do the same. The recruiters then earn a percentage of their recruits' sales. MLMs are legal, but they have been criticized for their business model, which often relies on recruitment rather than selling actual products. This leads to a high turnover rate and a focus on recruiting rather than building a sustainable business. These companies often make false health claims and exploit vulnerable populations, leading to harmful outcomes for both individuals and communities. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the health and wellness industry, MLMs sell products such as dietary supplements, weight loss shakes and skincare products. These products often come with health claims that are not supported by scientific evidence. For example, some MLMs claim that their products <a href=""https://draxe.com/essential-oils/what-is-frankincense/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">can cure cancer</span></a> or <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3228488&amp;page=1"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">other serious illnesses</span></a>, which is not only false but also dangerous. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">MLMs also target vulnerable people, such as those with chronic illnesses or disabilities. They promise a cure or way to manage their conditions, but these claims are often untrue. In addition to their negative impact on health, health MLMs can perpetuate systemic inequalities through their business practices. MLMs often target marginalized communities, including people of color and low-income individuals, promising financial success and health improvements. However, these promises are often proven to be false, leaving people in financial and physical distress. MLMs use high-pressure sales tactics and make false promises of financial success, which can lead to people losing the money they initially invested. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Moreover, MLMs perpetuate systemic inequalities through their recruitment practices. These companies often rely on personal networks and social connections, which can exclude people who do not have access to these networks. MLMs also require distributors to purchase large amounts of inventory upfront, which can be a barrier for people who do not have access to the necessary funds. Some companies also require their distributors to pay for training and other expenses, which can add up quickly. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To promote equity in health and wellness, it's important to prioritize evidence-based health practices and to support businesses that prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). This means holding health MLMs accountable for false or exaggerated health claims and their impact on marginalized communities. It also means supporting businesses that prioritize DEI in their recruitment practices and business operations. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To avoid falling victim to fraudulent health MLMs, here are some warning signs to look out for: </p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A distant associate reaching out to you on social media, especially if it seems like their initial and subsequent contact feels scripted.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Claims that their products can cure serious illnesses or conditions. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">High-pressure sales tactics and false promises of financial success. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Requiring distributors to buy large amounts of inventory upfront. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Requiring distributors to pay for training and other expenses. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While MLMs can be a legitimate business opportunity, health MLMs often rely on false health claims and prey on vulnerable people. It's essential to do your research before joining an MLM and to be aware of the warning signs of fraudulent companies. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Always prioritize your health and financial well-being over the promises of MLMs.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">On World Health Day, let's commit to promoting health equity and supporting businesses that prioritize the well-being of all individuals and communities. By doing so, we can create a healthier and more equitable world for everyone. </p>

136,<h1>Benford’s Law: How to Use It to Spot Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Kate Pospisil,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Conventional wisdom suggests that each digit has an equal chance of being the first digit, but Benford's law shows that lower numerals always have a greater chance at being the leading digit compared to higher numerals. Counting jobs start with low numbers and progress to include increasingly higher numbers; for example, when counting to 25, 11 numbers have a leading digit of 1, seven numbers have the leading digit of 2 and only one number leads with the digit 3. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In general, a series of numerical records follow Benford’s Law when they: </p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Signify records such as populations, river water flow or sizes of celestial bodies.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Don’t have pre-determined upper or lower limits.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Are not made up of numbers used as identifiers, such as identity or social security numbers, bank accounts or telephone numbers.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Have a lower mean than median, and data that are not concentrated around the mean. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Scientifically, Benford's Law is based on base-10 logarithms that show the probability that the leading digit of a number will be n can be calculated as log10(1+1/n). By substituting the numbers 1 through 9 for n, you can calculate that each subsequent number 1 through 9 has a diminishing probability that it will be the leading digit.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Computer-generated numbers give each numeral from 1 to 9 equal probability of being the leading digit. Using the above algorithm, equally weighted numbers would create a graph with straight-line results, thus potentiall indicating fraud. Analyzing data entered using the horizontal number keys on a keyboard could show a bell curve, using the reasonable assumption that dominant fingers — the index and middle fingers — would be hitting more numbers in the middle of the bar, 4, 5, 6 and 7. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Using Benford’s Law is one way to investigate fraudulent behavior and is a valuable tool in an anti-fraud toolkit, but it is not foolproof and should not be relied upon solely in an investigation. The process of counting leading digits will never determine without a doubt that fraud has occurred. However, if an expected Benford’s Law curve doesn’t show up in a data analysis, it does indicate that further investigation is warranted. </p>

137,<h1>Fraud Perspectives: Virtual Remote Work Forever</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Kate Pospisil,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I attended this webinar from my office, formulated the coverage plan on my commute and wrote this article from my home office. This is the current remote or hybrid reality for many in the professional realm in this post-COVID-19 world. Mason Wilder, the Research Manager at the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), sat down with Steve Dawson, CFE, CPA, President of DFG Forensic Accounting Services, and James Rumph, CFE, CIA, CPA, Senior Director of Enterprise Anti-Fraud Nationwide, for a virtual webinar hosted by the ACFE and The Institute of Internal Auditors (The IIA). The virtual audience was comprised of more than 50% hybrid employees and almost 40% fully remote, which embodies a very real culture shift in the post-pandemic professional workforce. While many of the audience members cited employee time theft as one of the biggest risks an organization faces with remote work, Rumph cited a recent study that showed the average remote worker actually put in an average of four additional work hours each week, along with experiencing a greater work/life balance. So, with clear risks and clearer benefits, how do organizations strike the right balance on the tightrope? </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Risks of a Remote Work Force </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As previously stated, the primary risk the audience mentioned in this webinar centered on employee time theft; they also mentioned overemployment, where a remote employee is putting hours in toward two full-time positions simultaneously. Business Email Compromise (BEC), the costliest type of cyberfraud, increased dramatically during the pandemic because the ability to monitor decreased, and the ways it’s committed evolved as well. Duties couldn’t be segregated and there were more important things to think about — such as how to maintain business function during a global pandemic — than maintaining internal controls, which quickly fell to the wayside. Rumph described cyberfraud as an “arms race,” with the sophistication of fraud continually increasing and a constant struggle for investigators to stay ahead of the curve. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another risk that organizations are facing in the post-pandemic professional realm is the high level of turnover and the risks that come along with that. Organizations are losing years of institutional knowledge and the protection and control that affords, as well as bringing in new employees facing training in a hybrid or remote environment. As Dawson mentioned, the workload within the organization has effectively doubled because everything — training, monitoring, leading a team, etc. — all must be done both in the traditional way and in the new remote way. Fraud didn’t stop with the pandemic; instead, it created a whole new generation of fraudsters working in an environment where the fraud fighters are also navigating a new normal. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Overcoming the Risks </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Dawson stated that one of the greatest things an organization can do to overcome the risk of a remote workforce in the fraud world is to focus on training. “We’ve got to get back to the human side … training, training, training … here’s what can happen, and here’s how to overcome it,” Dawson said. Even as technology to prevent fraud increases, so does technology to commit fraud, so the human element is still essential. Because everything happened so fast in the transition to a remote workforce, the time must be taken now to reevaluate internal control processes, codes of ethics, acceptable use policies and personnel in general. There’s no going back to “the way it was,” so we must all learn to navigate in this new reality.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Dawson also mentioned a higher level of the “me” mentality in today’s workforce, and organizations need to focus on reengaging the culture element. When anti-fraud programs are working, they protect everyone. Both speakers discussed the risks of over-monitoring and finding the right balance between respecting privacy and maintaining anti-fraud controls within organizations. Reincorporating pre-COVID-19 policies that worked — segregation of duties, mandatory vacations, etc. — and finding the right balance in remote monitoring is essential. As Dawson previously stated, this is double the work due to the multiple environments requiring monitoring, but this is the new reality. One way every organization can start is by increasing the perception of detection. This is likely the number one internal fraud control, and probably the first one to go in the rush to a remote workforce.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While the risks and benefits of a remote workforce are many and valid, the fact remains that its associated increased fraud risk is the new reality through which we are all navigating. Collaboration and maintaining the human element within an organization can go a long way toward reducing fraud, and striking a balance between reasonableness and protection can go a long way toward improving monitoring and the perception of detection. Above all, Rumph and Dawson agreed that a focus on reconnection between the organization and its workforce is desperately needed to move forward successfully.  </p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Benford’s Law is one of the most interesting things that so many do not know about — it feels like a trick, but it’s simply a law that applies for no apparent reason. Benford's Law is a theory that says that in lists of numbers, the first digits of the data set follow a pattern, i.e., random numbers are not always as random as you think they are. For more information about Benford’s Law, please see the previous blog in this series, <a href=""https://www.acfeinsights.com/acfe-insights/2023/3/14/benfords-law-what-it-is-and-why-fraud-examiners-use-itnbsp"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Benford’s Law: What It Is and Why Fraud Examiners Use it</a>.   </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If you are sampling data about something, Benford’s Law states that the leading digit follows a specific pattern: It is more likely that the first digit will be a 1 than a 2, a 2 than 3, a 3 than 4, and onward. There is a 1 in 3 chance the leading digit will be a 1, and a 1 in 20 chance that the leading digit will be a 9. But why though? <br/>
For example, let’s say that your city has a population of 100,000 people and you want to know what kind of percentage increase would be required in order to reach 200,000 people. This would require a 100% increase as the population would have to fully double to achieve a new leading digit. However, if our city was 900,000 instead of 100,000, then it only needs to grow by 11.1% in order to reach 1 as a leading digit with 1,000,000.  <br/>
Some interesting things that follow Benford’s Law are Tik Tok likes on popular videos, the area of countries across the world, and population counts. Population counts are actually the number two best fit in adherence to Benford’s Law, based on this massive data analysis. According to this data, the number one best fit for Benford’s Law is the number of people visiting a location or event each year. Fascinating! For more information about random things that abide by Benford’s Law, this video breaks it down very well.  <br/>
Benford’s Law cannot work on everything, of course. Things like ages of a specific group of people, such as NBA players, will generally have a 2 or 3 as the leading digit; heights of adults, which generally have a 6 or 7 as a leading digit in centimeters, or 5 or 6 in inches; or the lottery — don’t shoot the messenger, but winning lottery numbers will not abide by Benford’s Law. Lottery numbers aren’t the size or amount of anything: the numbers are really just symbols. I’m sorry. </p>

139,<h1>Case Study: Decoding the Cobweb of Letter of Credit</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: R Sumitra, CFE, MBA </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Recently, I worked on a case wherein a loan account of a bank turned bad, otherwise known as a non-performing asset. A preliminary investigation was conducted to know the genuine reason for the degradation of the loan account. The allegations included the diversion of the fund by the borrower, trade-based money laundering (TBML) through letters of credit and improper monitoring of the account by the bank. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>How the Auditor Carried Out the Investigation</strong> </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">First, the auditor requested data on letter of credit and analyzed the transactions during the past years. While reviewing the letter of credit transactions, the auditor created a master profile that included the purpose of the letter of credit, names of the transporters, the total amount, etc. The auditor conducted public domain searches on the suppliers and noted the names, addresses and related parties of the supplier. The auditor then performed transaction testing from the bank account statement of the borrower. Finally, the auditor checked the ""Terms &amp; Conditions of Sanction"" to know the purpose and justification for granting a letter of credit facility. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Based on the above analysis, the auditor noticed the following issues in the suspected borrower’s account: </p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There were inconsistencies in the issuance of the letter of credit with that of the purpose mentioned in the letter of sanction.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The beneficiaries of the letter of credit (i.e., the supplier) and the suspected borrowers were related parties.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As per the records, the supplier's registered office and the suspected borrower's warehouse were the same. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">During the preceding year a total of 135 letters of credit amounting to USD 73.33 million had been devolved. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Upon verification of the trade license number and trade tax number of the supplier in the public domain, it was found that the numbers were cancelled three years prior. The auditor also visited the address mentioned in the supplier's proforma invoice and made a discreet enquiry about the company. It turns out that no such company existed. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The company befooled the bank using fake documents. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As the investigation continued, the auditor visited the office of the transporter at the address mentioned in the lorry receipts, which required a serial number identifying the transport company. No such transport operator existed at the address that was listed. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">On perusal of the account statement of the suspected borrower, it was found that there were frequent credits of amounts from the suppliers' accounts to the suspected borrower's account. In addition, such transactions were more frequent after the issuance of a letter of credit. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The suspected borrower company was dealing in plastic commodities, whereas the suppliers were a dealer of iron and steel rods, revealing even more inconsistencies in the trade activities and additional evidence of money laundering through letters of credit. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Red Flags to Identify Money Laundering Through Letters of Credit </strong> </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When investigating fraudulent activity as it relates to letters of credit, the following red flags are important to explore during the preliminary investigation: </p>
<ol data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Over-invoicing or under-invoicing of goods. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Goods shipped to the buyers are misrepresented on the official document. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Noticeable change in the scale, volume and frequency of transactions, or a sudden change in the behavior of the customer. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The discrepancy between invoices and descriptions of the goods in the document. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Shipments routed through multiple unconnected subsidiaries without a valid reason. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Payment methods are inconsistent with the value of transactions. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Shipments are made to or from an unusual location. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The types of goods traded under the letter of credit are not in line with the regular business activity of the client. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Goods being shipped under letter of credit are not clear, and hence, difficult to determine the value of.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Complex transaction structuring.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Round-tripping of funds. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A high volume of transactions with the related parties.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Documents submitted with incomplete information. </li>
</ol>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Red flags are detection scenarios that call for further investigation and should be escalated as per guidelines, even if the transaction otherwise appears in order. It is essential to understand the red flags for preventing fraud, which can be unlocked through continuous monitoring and creating awareness by investing in the learning and development of employees. </p>

140,<h1>Investigating Insurance Fraud in Property Damage Claims</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Emma Richardson </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Picture a busy city street, littered with parked cars. One, a slate-grey 1998 Oldsmobile, is in real rough shape: sitting up on cinder blocks, the vehicle is surrounded by a sea of shattered glass. All four of its wheels are gone. Then, adding insult to vehicular injury, someone has carved the word “nasty” into the hood.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To most people, a sight like this would prompt a swift call to 311. For an entirely different demographic, however, a vandalized vehicle could send visions of dollar signs swirling through their heads. This mindset forms the backbone of a common auto insurance fraud scheme known as suspect property fraud. It is important to understand that, while many vandalism insurance claims may appear innocuous at first glance, every claims adjuster <em>must</em> be prepared to identify, handle, and most importantly, defeat the elements of fraud that may be present within these types of losses. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Suspect PD Fraud: The Basics </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When it comes to insurance fraud by the dollars, the <a href=""https://insurancefraud.org/fraud-stats/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Coalition Against Insurance Fraud</span></a> asserts that fraud across all lines of the insurance business costs policyholders an estimated <a href=""https://insurancefraud.org/fraud-stats/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">$308.6 billion annually<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">.</span></a> While it is difficult to ascertain the exact contribution of suspect property claims to this staggering number, one can be sure that this type of fraud won’t be drying up any time soon— unless suspect property claims are thoroughly and accurately investigated.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">So, how does one distinguish between a legitimate vandalism claim and a fraudulent one? For starters, it is necessary to put yourself in the shoes of someone with an urgent need. Let’s say your 2005 Volkswagen Jetta blew out its engine, and you’re in no position whatsoever to afford those repairs, let alone come up with the money for a down payment on a new vehicle or the monthly financing payments that will follow. One way to solve both your problems — financial and mechanical — would be to file a damage claim on your auto insurance policy, which would result in a settlement payment for the total loss of your Volkswagen. Since collisions can be hard to stage, that leaves a comprehensive loss, such as a fire, weather event, or in this case, vandalism, as a viable option to total out the unwanted vehicle. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Motive, motive, motive </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Suspected property fraud — as with all types of fraud — is driven entirely by motive. The two likeliest motives for committing suspect property fraud are financial or mechanical.  </p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Financial motive: </strong>If the policyholder filing the claim owns their vehicle outright, then there may be a financial motive to manufacture a loss, as the registered owner can expect to be paid for the actual cash value of the vehicle’s worth. If the vehicle is still being financed by a lending institution, then by experiencing a total loss, the owner could be releasing themselves from a loan that has gone upside down or otherwise become undesirable to continue.  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Mechanical motive: </strong>Many car owners find themselves pouring thousands of dollars into repairs on vehicles that are no longer worth the cost or trouble, especially if those repairs will ultimately outlive the vehicle’s long-term value. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When a claims adjuster is assigned to a new vehicle vandalism claim, there are multiple factors to consider at the beginning of the policy and coverage review. To begin with, an adjuster should always review any recent activity on the insured’s policy. For example, it is important to look for notable coverage changes that could be indicators of fraud: </p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Has the vehicle being claimed recently been added to the policy?  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Has first party coverage (that is, comprehensive and collision) been applied to an older-model vehicle?  </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Does this vehicle carry a lower comprehensive deductible than collision?  </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The bottom line is that if the policy’s history reflects unusual changes to coverages that would benefit the insured in the event of a loss, an adjuster may want to dig deeper and ask more questions about this during the recorded interview with the insured.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Just the Facts </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The reported facts of loss can carry an abundance of fraud indicators. Upon reviewing photos or a verbal description of the damages claimed, adjusters should ask themselves if a reasonable person would consider the damages to be “excessive.” A review of the reported loss location and timeline of events will likely prove beneficial to the claim’s investigation: in short, does it make sense for someone to have taken the time to vandalize a vehicle in a public setting?  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Let’s return to the 1998 Oldsmobile — remember, all four wheels are gone, at least one window is broken and the hood has been keyed. Think about how long it would take to accomplish all these tasks—probably at least 30 minutes, if not more. Now, consider the probability of being seen while in the act. Would you put the time in if you had nothing to gain and everything to lose? </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How Can Fraud Examiners Fight Back? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If something doesn’t feel right, then a detailed, recorded interview with the insured, coupled with a comprehensive review of the claim, is an adjuster’s best fraud fighting tool. Going over the loss in detail will empower any fraud examiner with independent sources of event corroboration and ideally confirm coverage is in order on the claim.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Additionally, having a stronger awareness of the indicators of suspect property fraud, as well as insight into the motives for doing so, can help bring a stronger level of awareness into an adjuster’s ability to verify the legitimacy of a reported loss. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Much like city wrecker services and abandoned cars, the insurance industry may always be cleaning up from the after-effects of fraud. But as long as qualified fraud examiners are paying attention to all the details, the battle to detect, deter and defeat fraud need not be so “nasty.” </p>

141,<h1>The Wayback Machine: A Tool for Nostalgia and Fraud Examination?</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The internet is a vast repository of information, with billions of web pages and websites documenting the digital footprints of people and organizations. However, as regular internet users know, web pages are not always permanent. Some are taken down, while many others are deleted or modified over time. This is where the <a href=""https://archive.org/web/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Wayback Machine</span></a> comes into play. As part of the <a href=""https://archive.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Internet Archive</span></a>, a non-profit digital library founded in 1996, the Wayback Machine contains a historic log of an estimated 735 billion web pages, making it an incredibly powerful database supporting a range of businesses and industries.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In 2017, a second circuit court of appeals in New York upheld challenges from Fabio Gasperini<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">, </span>an Italian computer hacker who was convicted of misdemeanor computer intrusion. Screenshots from the Wayback Machine were entered as evidence in the case against him, confirming that websites he ran tied him to the virus and botnet scam for which he was convicted. Gasperini appealed, contesting that the screenshots could not be legitimate or verifiable, which was debunked following confirmation from an Internet Archive employee on their authenticity. This ruling paved the way for this type of evidence to be used in securing future convictions, which remains a valuable tool for fraud investigations.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">One of the main ways that the Wayback Machine can be used in fraud investigations is by identifying changes made to a website or web page. For example, if a company is suspected of fraudulently altering information on their website, investigators can use the Wayback Machine to view the historical record of that website and identify any changes that were made. This can include changes to pricing information, product descriptions or other important information that may be relevant to the investigation.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Wayback Machine can also be useful in fraud investigations by providing evidence of fraudulent activities. If a company is suspected of engaging in false advertising or misrepresenting their products or services, investigators can retrieve historical records of the company's website or web pages, which may reveal evidence of misleading claims or false information.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In addition to identifying changes and providing evidence of fraudulent activities, the Wayback Machine can be used to identify potential witnesses or accomplices. With a range of website designers, content creators or other individuals who may be involved in maintaining web pages over many years, investigators can use the Wayback Machine to identify individuals who were involved in the creation or maintenance of the website or web pages in question. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Not only can the Wayback Machine be used to investigate fraud, it can also be used to prevent it. For example, banks and financial institutions can use the Wayback Machine to monitor the websites of potential clients or partners. By checking the historical content of these websites, banks can identify red flags early in the vetting process to protect their institutions from fraudulent activities.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">However, the Wayback Machine is not foolproof. Some websites may use robots.txt files, for example, to block the Wayback Machine from archiving their content or use other methods to hide or modify their historical content. The Wayback Machine only archives publicly accessible websites, so it may not be useful in investigating fraud that occurs on private or encrypted platforms. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In conclusion, the Wayback Machine can be a powerful tool in fraud investigations. It allows investigators to access historical evidence of website content and structure, which can help them identify and prosecute fraudsters. While the Wayback Machine is not an end-all for fraud prevention, it is an important tool that can be used by law enforcement agencies, financial institutions and other organizations looking for another opportunity to protect themselves and their clients from fraud risks.</p>

142,<h1>Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship Recipient: Jordan Newman </h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Meet Jordan Newman, a driven individual who received the prestigious <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/about-the-acfe/acfe-foundation/scholarship"">Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship</a> for excelling in his professional and academic pursuits. Along with being a full-time tax accountant at Pace &amp; Company, he is also a graduate assistant at the Georgia Southern School of Accountancy where he works as a writing assistant and tutor. Jordan recently obtained his CPA designation in the state of Georgia and is now pursuing his Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) credential. Currently, Jordan is a Master of Accounting student at Georgia Southern University. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you hear about the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship, and what made you decide to apply? </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I learned about the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship from one of my accounting professors at Georgia Southern University. She had mentioned many of the details of the scholarship and asked me if I was planning to apply. Like many, my first thought was that I had a very small chance of receiving a national scholarship. My professor influenced my application, and I am so happy she did.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Joining the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) and receiving this scholarship has been amazing. The ACFE provides an abundance of resources for networking opportunities as well as fraud-related journals. Such resources have aided in advancing my career, knowledge and perception of fighting fraud. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become passionate about fighting fraud? </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I have always had a passion for fighting fraud. Going into college, I was undecided with my career path. At first, I selected a very generalized course path until I could find the one part of college that just clicked with me. A few semesters into college, I realized I was always drawn to instances of fraud cases. Around the same time, several of the amazing accounting professors at Georgia Southern University made me realize my love for accounting. As these professors would teach in their class, I would always be thinking about the fraud that could take place in any instance. Every time I had a class project, fraud was the topic on which I would focus. This resonance coupled with my admiration of human behavior, social sciences, criminology and accounting showed me that fighting fraud would be in my future.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I currently work as a full-time tax accountant, and even in the work that I do now, I always keep fraud, or merely uncovering unethical decisions, in the back of my mind. One day, I hope to be able to make a career out of fighting fraud. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What advice do you have for students who are interested in applying for the scholarship? </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If you are truly passionate about fraud, apply for this scholarship. The connections you can make through the ACFE are unmatched. In addition, the number of resources that would be at your disposal will set you far ahead in your career. Every student has a shot at receiving this scholarship. Advancing one’s knowledge and admiration for the field of fighting fraud is the main goal of this scholarship, and it is out there for whoever is eager enough to pursue it.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I am not far enough in my career to really come across many interesting stories of fraud. However, I have learned that you should always stick to what you admire. Many might find accounting to be a dry field of study — it most certainly is not for everyone. However, fighting fraud as a Forensic Accountant or even as a CFE can be a very enticing field. This is a field where one never stops learning; the day-to-day life is anything but mundane, and the societal implications of the work performed are perpetually expanding.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship is just one step along the way; a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to set you apart and advance your career.  If I have anything to add, it would be to make pursuit of all these opportunities and really concentrate on what you want to do. Fight for your passions, absorb the knowledge of college, and become the exemplar of who you want to be and what you want to do. </p>

143,<h1>Behavioral Biometrics: The Next Big Weapon to Fight Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Carthic Kameshwaran</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Behavioral biometrics is a modern method of identifying individuals based on the way they interact with devices, such as computers and smartphones. It is used to verify the identity of an individual through the analysis of patterns of human behavior, such as mouse movements, typing speed and pressure on touchscreens. Unlike traditional biometric methods, such as fingerprint scanning or face recognition, behavioral biometrics does not require any physical input from the user, making it a more convenient and less intrusive form of identification. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Adoption in Fraud Prevention </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Behavioral biometrics is a <a href=""http://biotech-asia.org/vol10no2/a-behavioral-biometric-authentication-system-based-on-memory-game"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">relatively new technology</span></a>, but it has already been widely adopted by organizations and individuals for a range of purposes. One of the most common applications of behavioral biometrics is in the field of cybersecurity, where it is used to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. For example, it can be used to detect unauthorized access attempts by monitoring the way a user interacts with a device and comparing it to previous behavior patterns. If the behavior does not match what is expected, the system can flag the activity as suspicious and take appropriate measures to prevent it. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another application is in the field of mobile banking, where it is used to enhance the security of online transactions. By monitoring the way a user interacts with their device, the bank can verify the identity of the user and ensure that they are indeed the person who is making the transaction. This reduces the risk of fraud and helps to protect the customer’s sensitive information. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Adoption in Operational Efficiency </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In addition to its applications in cybersecurity and mobile banking, behavioral biometrics is also being used in the workplace to increase productivity and efficiency. For example, it can be used to monitor the performance of employees and identify areas where they need improvement. By tracking the way an employee interacts with their device, the system can detect patterns of behavior that are associated with low productivity, such as taking frequent breaks or spending too much time on non-work-related activities. This information can then be used to provide targeted training and support, helping to improve overall productivity and efficiency. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another benefit of behavioral biometrics is its ability to improve the user experience. By tracking the way an individual interacts with a device, the system can learn their behavior patterns and preferences, making it easier for the user to complete tasks and access information. This can help to reduce frustration and improve the overall user experience. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Challenges </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Despite the many benefits of behavioral biometrics, there are also some potential risks and challenges that must be considered. One of the main concerns is privacy, as the technology involves collecting and analyzing sensitive information about an individual’s behavior patterns. This information could potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or profiling. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another challenge is the accuracy of behavioral biometrics. While the technology has made significant advancements in recent years, there is still a risk of false negatives or false positives. For example, a change in behavior, such as an injury or illness, could result in a false negative, preventing the individual from accessing their device or account. On the other hand, a false positive could result in the system mistakenly identifying a malicious user as the legitimate one. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Finally, there is the issue of cost, as implementing a behavioral biometrics system can be expensive. This includes the cost of purchasing and deploying the necessary hardware and software, as well as the cost of training staff and providing support to users. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Final Notes </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In conclusion, behavioral biometrics is a promising technology with many potential applications and benefits. However, it is important to consider the potential risks and challenges before adopting the technology, including privacy, accuracy and cost. By carefully balancing the benefits and risks, organizations and individuals can make informed decisions about the use of behavioral biometrics and ensure that they are using the technology in an appropriate manner. </p>

144,<h1>Fraud Talk: Confessions of a Fraudster</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>In this episode of Fraud Talk, the ACFE's Chief Training Officer John Gill sat down with Charles Antonucci, the former president of The Park Avenue Bank, who was convicted in 2015 of trying to defraud the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Antonucci also pleaded guilty to other charges including self-dealing, bribery, embezzlement of bank funds, and a multi-million fraud scheme involving an insurance company. The ACFE does not compensate convicted fraudsters.</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>In this excerpt, Charles Antonucci speaks about running The Park Avenue Bank during the Great Recession:</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Charles</strong>: We grew the bank immediately from-- I think the first year we went from 25 million to 100 million. We used broker deposits as a tool. Then within the first three years, we were close to 400 million. I built the branch in Borough Park. I built another one in Bay Ridge, particularly catering to the Orthodox community. We were moving along pretty well. Until 2008. [chuckles]</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The proverbial [beep] hit the fan. We were in the real estate business. 80% of our loans were real estate loans, either the bridge loans or loans that we made directly. The first crack was when the Wall Street firms started collapsing. We had preferred stock in Fannie Mae at the time. When Fannie Mae failed, we lost-- I think it was $5 million, which triggered another series of events. Dropped our capital ratio below 10% and we had to be at 10% because we had broken deposits. We're up [beep] creek, so to speak.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We met with the regulatory organization. We went down, we met with the superintendent. We said, ""Listen, here's our problem. We got 200 million of broker deposits maturing over the next three months. My capital ratio is below 10%. I can't meet the requirement, but we'll go out of business. We'll liquidate. We need to raise $5 million to keep this thing afloat.""</p>

145,<h1>Protect Yourself from Tax Preparer Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Tax season can be a stressful time for many people, and it's important to be vigilant in order to protect yourself from tax preparer fraud. Here are some tips to help you prepare: </p>
<ol>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Do your research</strong>: Before you choose a tax preparer, make sure to research their background and qualifications. Check online reviews and verify if they have a PTIN (Preparer Tax Identification Number) from the IRS. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Ask questions</strong>: Don't be afraid to ask questions about your tax preparer's experience and qualifications. You can also ask for references from previous clients. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Verify their credentials</strong>: Check the National Association of Tax Professionals (NATP) or the National Association of Enrolled Agents (NAEA) to see if your tax preparer is a member. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Review your tax return carefully</strong>: Before you sign your tax return, make sure you understand all the information and the calculations. Check for any errors or suspicious information. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Keep a copy of your tax return</strong>: Always keep a copy of your tax return and all supporting documents in a safe place. This can help you in case you need to dispute any errors in the future. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Be wary of promises of big refunds</strong>: Be cautious of tax preparers who guarantee large refunds or promise that you'll get a refund, even if you haven't had any taxes withheld from your pay.<strong></strong></li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Don't give out personal information</strong>: Don't give out personal information, such as your Social Security number or bank account number, unless you are sure the tax preparer is legitimate. </li>
</ol>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By following these tips, you can help protect yourself from tax preparer fraud and ensure that your tax return is accurate and handled properly. If you suspect that you've been a victim of tax preparer fraud, contact the IRS immediately. </p>

147,"<h1>Member Spotlight: Frank Dara, CFE</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Frank Dara, CFE worked his way up from a Loss Prevention in-store Detective to becoming the  North America Investigations Manager for Nike after years of fraud fighting. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This is his story in his own words.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become passionate about fighting fraud?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">After graduating from the University of South Florida with my Bachelor of Arts in Criminology, I obtained my first role as a store loss prevention detective. Being on the front line of theft and fraud, I quickly saw the impact that fraud and crime can have, not only against corporations, but against people. For me, it’s all about your impact on people and society. Retail workers must execute a business’ strategy to be profitable while executing multiple responsibilities for an organization. When you see others taking advantage of profits while your business partners are putting in such efforts, it was easy for me to become passionate about combatting fraud. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud is like a puzzle that needs to be solved. Taking ownership and pride in my work, while solving the puzzle with integrity, enforces my passion for making a positive difference in society.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you get to your current role? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">My current role at Nike is the North America Investigations Manager, which supports all retail. To obtain this role, I went through just about every level of loss prevention: Mall Security Officer, Store Detective, LP Manager, LP Investigator, Multi Unit LP Manager, Organized Retail Crime Investigations, Global Corporate Investigator and now Investigations Manager! I have worked for what I see as the world’s leading big box retailer, discount retailer and now sports apparel company. Broadening my experience by working for some world-class retailers and taking on various roles with expanding responsibilities allowed me to achieve the role I’m in today. Although I have put in the work, none of this could have been possible without the support of many personal and professional mentors from our industry. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What are challenges you face in your role?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The challenges in my role are like any other loss prevention department that has brick and mortar stores and sells in the digital space. Retail has become a lucrative target for the bad actor, and it does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The ever-changing fraud schemes, theft for resell, online selling platforms and the changing legislation that has reduced penalties for retail property crimes continue to challenge the loss prevention industry as a whole. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is an important lesson you’ve learned in your career?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An important lesson I have learned is the value of relationships and partnerships. The loss prevention industry is what I would consider a very small and tight-knit community. I would not have been successful in my career without all the established partnerships, whether they are fraud professionals or with law enforcement agencies.  I truly believe your network is your net worth in this line of work. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is important to you about being a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE)?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Being a CFE means I have taken the personal step to join a world class organization. It’s about challenging myself to remain current in the industry with trends and general education. The CFE credential is truly the gold stamp of professionalism, education and integrity! Out of all the certifications I have, this is the one I proudly display on my LinkedIn profile. </p>

148,<h1>AI Fraud: The Hidden Dangers of Machine Learning-Based Scams</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Laura Harris,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Artificial intelligence (AI) itself is not inherently fraudulent. AI is a field of computer science that focuses on the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human-like intelligence, such as learning, problem solving and decision making. AI technologies are used in a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, language translation and image recognition.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">However, like any technology, AI can be used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes. There is the potential for AI to be used to facilitate fraudulent activities, such as  generating fake or misleading information, or automating scams or other fraudulent schemes. AI can also be used to detect and prevent fraud by analyzing data and identifying patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Machine learning is a subfield of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data and improve its performance over time. Machine learning has already made a significant impact in a variety of fields, including computer science, finance, healthcare and transportation, and it is expected to continue to play a major role in the future of AI and other emerging technologies with the development of new algorithms and approaches that can enable machine learning systems to perform more complex and sophisticated tasks.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The use of AI in fraud depends on how it is implemented and used. Individuals and organizations should be aware of the potential risks and take appropriate measures to protect themselves from fraudulent activity, whether it involves AI or other technologies.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There are a few reasons why someone might use AI for fraudulent purposes:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Speed and efficiency: AI can process large amounts of data and perform tasks quickly, which makes it a potentially useful tool for automating fraudulent activities.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Anonymity: AI can be used to carry out fraudulent activities without leaving a traceable human trail.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Evasion of detection: AI can be used to generate fake or misleading information that is difficult for humans to detect as fraudulent.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Personal gain: Fraud is often motivated by a desire to obtain financial or other benefits through deceptive or dishonest means. AI can be used as a tool to facilitate this type of activity.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Generating fake or misleading information: AI could be used to create fake websites, social media accounts, or other online content that is designed to deceive or mislead people. This could include generating fake reviews or manipulating online ratings to mislead consumers.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Automating scams: AI could be used to automate scams or fraudulent schemes, such as by sending out mass emails or text messages that are designed to trick people into revealing sensitive information or sending money.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Spoofing phone numbers or email addresses: AI could be used to create fake phone numbers or email addresses that are designed to deceive people into thinking they are communicating with a legitimate entity.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Generating fake documents: AI could be used to create fake documents, such as contracts or invoices, that are designed to mislead or deceive people.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Automation of scams: AI could be used to automate scams or fraudulent schemes, such as by sending out mass emails or text messages that are designed to trick people into revealing sensitive information or sending money. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Evasion of detection: AI could be used to evade detection by generating fake or misleading information that is difficult for humans to identify as fraudulent. This could make it more difficult for authorities to identify and track down cybercriminals.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Increased sophistication of attacks: AI could be used to increase the sophistication of cyber-attacks, such as by generating more convincing phishing emails or by adapting to the defenses of targeted organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Impersonation</strong></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">AI systems can be used to impersonate a real person in a number of ways, depending on the specific context and the capabilities of the AI system in question. Here are a few examples of how AI could be used to impersonate a real person:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">AI systems can be trained to generate text or speech that is designed to mimic the style, tone, and language patterns of a particular person. This could include generating social media posts, emails, or other forms of written communication that are designed to sound like they were written by a verified source.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">AI systems can be used to generate images or videos that are designed to look like a particular person.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">AI systems can be used to manipulate online profiles or accounts to make them appear more like the person being impersonated, including changing profile information or generating fake activitiy on social media or other online platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The use of AI to impersonate a real person can be a highly sophisticated and effective form of deception, and it is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the potential for this type of activity and to take steps to protect themselves from it.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There are a few ways you can tell the difference between writing produced by a person and writing produced by AI. Here are a few things to consider:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Style and tone: AI-generated writing may lack the subtle nuances and variations in style and tone that are characteristic of human writing. It may also contain repetitive or formulaic language.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Grammar and syntax: AI-generated writing may contain errors in grammar and syntax that are less common in human writing.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Cohesion and organization: AI-generated writing may be less cohesive and less well-organized than writing produced by a person. It may lack transitions or logical connections between ideas.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Context and content: AI-generated writing may be less contextually relevant or may contain content that is unrelated to the topic at hand.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It is important to note that the capabilities of AI in generating human-like writing have improved significantly in recent years, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between writing produced by AI and writing produced by a person. In some cases, it may be necessary to use multiple methods or to consult with experts in order to determine the source of a given piece of writing.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There are a number of steps that individuals and organizations can take to prevent AI-assisted fraud. Some recommendations include:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Implement strong security measures, such as using unique passwords for all accounts, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping all software and security protocols up to date.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Be cautious about sharing personal information. Be selective about the personal information you share online and be cautious about responding to requests for personal information from unknown sources.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Verify the authenticity of information and communications. Be skeptical of information and communications that seem suspicious or too good to be true and take steps to verify their authenticity before acting on them.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Educate yourself about the common signs of fraudulent activity, such as unsolicited requests for personal information or offers that seem too good to be true.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Report suspicious activity. If you suspect that you are the target of fraudulent activity, or if you come across suspicious information or communications, report it to the appropriate authorities or organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By following these recommendations, you can help protect yourself and your organization from AI-assisted fraud and other forms of cybercrime.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">ACFE Training Director, Jason Zirke, CFE, used AI to write the following anti-fraud poem:</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A deceitful act, a moral waste</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Lies and tricks for personal gain</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Leaving others in financial pain</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">From identity theft to Ponzi schemes</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud takes on many different means</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It preys on those who trust and believe</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Leaving them hurt with no relief</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It lurks in shadows, waiting to pounce</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It preys on those who don't keep an ounce</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Of skepticism, or trust too much</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Falling victim to its wicked touch</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">But fear not, for justice will prevail</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The guilty will be sent to jail</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">They’ll pay for their crimes, that much is true</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraudsters can’t escape their due</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""> So, report the fraud and don't be shy</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Seek help, don't let the fraudster by</p>

149,"<h1>""Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street"": Netflix Releases Gripping New Series</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">John Duffley </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As the modern fascination with true crime escalates, perhaps no documentarian today presents the stories of our past with more profundity than Joe Berlinger. The Acadamy Award-nominated director boasts a filmography that includes “Brother’s Keeper,” the “Paradise Lost” trilogy and “Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru.” In recent years, Berlinger partnered with Netflix to create and direct the “Conversations with a Killer” documentary series that uses depositions from serial killers Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer to retell their gripping stories—a calling card of sorts that has become Berlinger’s style. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The director’s next endeavor figures to hit home for not just millions of Americans but anti-fraud professionals around the world, too. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">“Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street” released on Netflix on January 4, 2023. The four-part series utilizes deposition footage of convicted fraudster Bernie Madoff, whose $64.8 billion Ponzi scheme came crashing down in 2008 after decades of illicit activity. Additionally, reenactments provide a dramatic effect to the story, a cast that includes actor Joseph Scotto portraying Madoff (who bears an uncanny resemblance to the infamous fraudster). </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Testimonials include former Madoff employees, journalists, investors who saw their life savings vanish, and Harry Markopolos, the Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) whose allegations around Madoff’s fraudulent activity were dismissed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) despite multiple submissions by Markopolos over a 10-year span.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Ultimately, Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison and died on April 14, 2021. Billions of dollars were gone, families saw their life savings disappear and lives were lost to suicide— only increasing the gravity of what occurred due to greed. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">“Madoff was the scapegoat for the [2008] financial crisis,” Markopolos said in the series’ official trailer. “But in a blue-collar crime, the bodies drop before you investigate. In a white-collar crime, they drop afterwards.” </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Buckle up: this new Netflix series is going to be a must-watch in 2023. </p>

150,<h1>Case Study: The Employee and Vendor Nexus</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Mohit Jain, CFE</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Recently, I worked on a case wherein a whistleblower raised allegations on two employees that the company was engaging in unethical practices. The allegations included bribery and corruption, conflict of interest, breach of code of conduct, misappropriation of assets, high prices and poor quality of products supplied and abuse of position. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While the whistleblower had not indicated the names of employees in the whistleblower letter, they mentioned the name of the department of the company under which such unethical practices were being followed. An auditor conducted the preliminary investigation based on the whistleblower letter.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How the auditor identified the employees and carried out the investigation</h2>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The auditor requested the purchase data of the department in question and started analyzing the transactions conducted during the past years. Next, they created a detailed profile of the employees working in the department.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">During the review of transactions with the vendor, the auditor performed transactions testing of the vendors using samples and requested the supporting documents required, as per company policy, such as purchase requisition, quotation, comparative statement, goods receipt note, gate pass, invoice, payment voucher and any other supporting available for the transaction.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The auditor performed analytics on the vendor master of the company and listed the type of vendors, such as existence of vendor, turnover of the vendor over the years and type of products supplied by the vendor.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The auditor conducted public domain searches on the vendor and noted the owner of vendor, address of the vendor, related parties of the vendor, establishment date of vendor firms, etc.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The auditor also performed fuzzy logic on employee master and vendor master based on scenarios like common name, common address, common phone number, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Based on the above analysis, the auditor listed the suspected vendors and reviewed all the transactions of the suspected vendors to identify the potential wrongdoings. The auditor noticed the following issues in the suspected vendor’s analysis:</p>
<ol data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Conflict of interest between vendor and employee, wherein employee’s spouse was the partner in the suspected vendor’s company/firm.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Communications indicating vendor favoritism by the employee, such as preferential treatment of payments to suspected vendor and quotation only obtained from suspected vendor.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Sharing of confidential information with the suspected vendor.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Kickbacks by the suspected vendor to employee family member’s account.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Inexistent manufacturing facilities declared by the suspected vendor at the time of onboarding (Site visits on the manufacturing facilities revealed the results.) </li>
</ol>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Based on the above findings, the auditor prepared the questionnaire and interviewed the employees indulged in unethical practices. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The top red flags to identify corruption in the organization include:</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">1. Red flags to identify corrupt vendor/supplier:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"" style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Supply poor quality of goods despite no questions raised, or they are continually awarded the work.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Charges unjustified high prices or raises additional cost invoices frequently.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Offers inappropriate gifts or provides lavish business entertainment.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Close nexus with an employee (Address of supplier/vendor matches with the employees address or employee's relative address, know-your-customer [KYC] documents of vendor match with the employee's KYC), etc.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Provides an incomplete address or contact details.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Provides multiple addresses.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Works with competitors and passes confidential information to the competitor in exchange for awards/contracts.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Has various companies in the same industry and uses them for bid rigging.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Displays indicators such as poor performance record, history of fraudulent contract, family ties with an employee, lack of qualification or experience, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 40px;"">Although detecting and preventing vendor fraud is not easy, identifying key areas where there is a lack of control and implementing stronger controls and measures can go a long way in preventing vendor fraud cases.</p>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap;"">2. Red flags to identify corrupt employee:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"" style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Lifestyle is not commensurate with the income earned.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Forces subordinates to bend the rules for personal gain.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Circumstances arise that generate extreme personal pressures, such as ill family members, huge personal liabilities, etc.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">History of not filing conflict of interest forms or Global Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) declaration.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Close association with suppliers.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Inclination to make excuses for deficiencies in supplier's products or services, such as poor quality, late deliveries or high prices.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 40px;"">The presence of one or two red flags does not necessarily imply the presence of wrongdoing and may highlight some other external pressure or challenge exists in a person’s life. Understanding and recognizing red flags is an important fraud prevention strategy and can be unlocked through investing in regular fraud awareness education for the employees.</p>

151,"<h1>As Lisa Osofsky Steps Down, What’s Next for the SFO?</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Martin Kenney </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It comes as no surprise to learn that Lisa Osofsky is <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/848b3181-4d88-4fcc-9e9a-e7acb4bb1f63"">stepping down next summer</a> after five years as head of the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO).</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Ms. Osofsky has overseen an often contentious five years at the helm of the U.K.’s leading fraud prosecution agency. She has made several significant mistakes, which Tony McClements (our firm’s head of investigations) and myself have both commented upon, most recently when Tony <a href=""https://fcpablog.com/2022/10/25/how-can-lisa-osofsky-save-the-serious-fraud-office/"">suggested</a> that the SFO should be merged with Britain’s FBI-equivalent, the National Crime Agency (NCA).</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To my mind, the SFO has lost its way. It is staffed by eminently qualified and experienced investigators and lawyers but appears to have veered off course. I am not attributing all the blame to Ms. Osofsky. I am merely pointing out that the person at the top needs to ensure optimal operation of their team.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Averaging five prosecutions per year for an organization as big and as well funded as the SFO is disappointing. Granted, it is investigating complex fraud cases that will often take several years to conclude, but one should still expect more.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Ms. Osofsky <a href=""https://www.law360.com/corporate-crime-uk/articles/1541273/sfo-chief-regrets-meeting-with-damaging-unaoil-fixer"">has admitted</a> to making errors in judgement. Some of these errors have been highlighted in two recent reports into SFO failings, including erring in its Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) disclosure obligations. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">These mistakes were elementary, and I believe would never have happened under the stewardship of an experienced investigator drawn from law enforcement. In fact, I would go as far as to say that the modern law enforcement observer would consider the mistakes made in the SFO’s handling of <a href=""https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/serious-farce-sfo-slammed-over-unaoil-case-as-third-conviction-quashed/5113198.article"">Unaoil prosecutions</a> to be astounding (where disclosure failures led to the freeing of three previously convicted individuals).</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It may be, as Tony has suggested, that the SFO should come under the umbrella and stewardship of the National Crime Agency. This would ensure the guidance and support of an agency that includes former law enforcement operatives from the police and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I find the SFO’s move towards deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs), which allow companies to avoid prosecution if they admit their wrongdoing and improve their culture and compliance, as well as paying significant fines, to be counterproductive. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If an organization has simply failed to meet standards of compliance, with no dishonest intent, then they can be dealt with by way of fiscal penalties implemented by other overseers of the UK financial services and business sectors. The SFO should be focused entirely on prosecuting those who are dishonest and culpable of fraud. The clue is in the name. Otherwise, the SFO becomes one of many regulators, rather than an agency specialized in the prosecution of fraud and corruption.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The SFO needs a review and shakeup. I am not advocating for disbandment, but this is a gilt-edged opportunity for the U.K. Government to consider SFO reform options, both in respect to leadership and the SFO’s relationship to the broader U.K. law enforcement infrastructure.</p>

152,<h1>Cyber Week Scams</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Samuel May,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The growing trend of shoppers preferring pajamas and pumpkin pie to cold weather and crowds reached an all-time high in 2021 as online shopping for the holiday season soared due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, global online sales again hit a new high of $281 billion during Cyber Week (Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday); that figure was up 2% from the pandemic season, according to <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/salesforce-reveals-record-breaking-cyber-week-281-billion-in-global-online-sales-301689543.html#:~:text=Overall%2C%202022%20global%20online%20sales,up%209%25%20compared%20to%202021.&amp;text=The%20data%20showed%20a%20departure,throughout%20the%20month%20of%20November."">Salesforce</a>, with Cyber Monday alone accounting for $11.3 billion in online sales, according to <a href=""https://business.adobe.com/resources/holiday-shopping-report"">Adobe Analytics</a>. Black Friday, by comparison, reached $9.12 billion in online sales and reportedly light foot traffic. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This year was also novel for <em>how</em> customers made their purchases: for the first time ever, most online sales were made through mobile devices. Mobile sales accounted for 44% of all sales last year but reached 51% in 2022. As for how customers made their way to their purchase, 28% of online orders originated from a paid search, 18% were from customers going directly to retail websites, 17% from clicking a link in an email, and 15% originated from an organic search. (Paid searching is defined as an organization paying for a prominent position on search result pages versus organic searching where the organization optimizes their website’s visibility to appear in search results more “naturally.”)</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">So, what do all these numbers mean for fraud examiners?</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Scam artists typically take the path of least resistance and follow the money. Early <a href=""https://newsroom.transunion.com/holiday-fraud-2022/"">results</a> from Cyber Week 2022 saw average suspected digital fraud attempts increase 82% over the earlier part of the year. TransUnion analytics estimate that 15% of all global e-commerce transactions between November 24 and November 28 were potentially fraudulent. Fraud examiners should make every attempt to plan ahead and work on prevention through education. Looking toward 2023 with 2022 already in the books, a few recommendations can be made:</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Email Scams</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Virtually every cybersecurity educational resource will remind individuals to dutifully check each email they receive for telltale signs of deception and to avoid clicking included links or downloading attached documents. Even in ideal scenarios, email scams and phishing attempts still succeed from time to time. During the busiest sales days of the year, where every email inbox is bombarded with dozens and dozens of temptations, customers will be even more vulnerable. The same techniques fraudsters use to get individuals to click into a phishing scam are employed by companies wanting to boost their end-of-year figures. <em>Last chance! Buy now! Deals you can’t afford to miss! </em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Cybersecurity professionals can take a bit of solace in this year’s figures. While 17% of sales came from individuals clicking through an email link, 18% took the effort of going directly to their preferred site. The message is getting through, but repetition is important. One well-crafted email scam is all it takes for a Grinch to spoil a holiday season.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Text Scams</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Text scams are somewhat new, but they’re similar to email scams. Customers should be educated on avoiding following links in instant messages or downloading attachments or images from unknown sources. With the rise of mobile sales, companies and scam artists alike are more frequently sending out text messages to entice customers to click. This includes messages for upcoming deals, fake order messages, fake delivery messages and all manner of other communications. Customers should be advised to, once again, avoid clicking, calling or engaging with text messages and go directly to the website they ordered from to resolve any alleged issues.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fake Websites</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The highest percentage of online sales were driven by paid searches and/or sponsored links. Generally, these are legitimate companies that have put money toward appearing on the top of the page when particular phrases are searched. Such a large piece of the online sales pie will also inevitably attract fraudsters looking to perpetuate a larger scam; all that is required is an upfront investment to get their link to the top of the page. As with all online advertisements, customers need to be reminded to resist the initial temptation to click. While some organizations put significant effort into curating and verifying advertisements or sponsored content that appears on their website, not all of them put forth the same effort or fully succeed in filtering out bad actors. A bad ad can lead to a fake website where victims give up their credit cards or identifying information in pursuit of a good deal. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Organizations can help combat Cyber Week sales fraud by preparing for an increase in account takeovers and fake profiles. They can monitor important data trends like declined transactions and projected sales volume increases from broadcast deals in order to understand how to best protect their customers.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This holiday season is sure to set more records for fraud commensurate with the increase in sales and spending. While the customer is ultimately responsible for protecting themselves from phishing, identity theft, or any of the myriad of e-commerce scams, fraud examiners can work to anticipate increased vulnerabilities and help to educate customers and organizations. Despite our culturally agreed upon practice of ignoring our weight during these food and festival filled months, an ounce of prevention is still worth a pound of cure.</p>

154,"<h1>Member Spotlight: Angelica Isgleas Pacheco, CFE</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Angelica Isgleas Pacheco, CFE, began her career as an auditor for an accounting firm. She found her love for fighting fraud through her career and has excelled due to her passion for her community. This is her story in her own words.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become passionate about fighting fraud?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I’m an accountant, and I started my career in 2001 as an auditor working in one of the Big Four accounting firms. (In that time, it was the “Big Five.”) I got interested in going further than just checking internal controls, so in 2006, I began reviewing processes of the companies that integrate the group I worked for. I figured out that there were a lack of controls, or they were very soft, everywhere in the companies. Then, as a decision of my director in 2015, I was asked to start working on a team that practices e-discovery revisions, as I have a lot of background of how the companies work and their processes. I gave very good results and fraud findings, so that’s how I got very passionate about fighting fraud.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you get to your current role? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Working in a corporate group from 2006 to 2020 gave me the opportunity to get to know a lot of people in the same group, so I was transferred to one of the companies as a head of an investigations team. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What are challenges you face in your role?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">First, the culture of how we do business here in Mexico. New generations, as they are trained for people that behave in a bad manner, can be influenced in the wrong way. We need to convince our employees who commit fraud that it does not just affect their job or area — it affects our company, our group and our country.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We are working hard training our employees and third parties to fight against fraud through our code of conduct, policies and procedures, talks in our organization about what defines a conflict of interest, what are fraud, corruption, collusion, etc. and the consequences an employee faces if we find out.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is an important lesson you’ve learned in your career?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Even if it looks difficult to discover fraud in some cases, I must continue working very hard as I’m convinced that our job is crucial in each company and that we are a very important piece against fraud. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is important to you about being a CFE?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Studying to become a CFE was one of the most gratifying things I have done in all my career; I’m very proud of that. I encourage others to become a CFE because this certification gave me a lot of knowledge in several areas. Once you become a CFE, you’ll want to learn more and more, and of course, contribute by finding ways and tools to fight against fraud as part of the ACFE community.</p>

155,<h1>Case Study: Overseas Contractor Bribed Official to Defraud the U.S. Government</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Eduardo Cuyos, CPA, CICA, DCFM3</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A few years ago, I worked overseas as the director of internal audit and investigation. The organization’s headquarters had seven other support organizations to protect U.S. territory and resources. The director of the moral, welfare, and recreation (MWR) received funding from the federal government to take care of soldiers, civilian employees and their families for all recreational and morale booster activities. One of the latest programs was the Warrior Adventure Quest (WAQ) Program. WAQ was developed by the Army Medical Department; it is an Army RESET training tool designed to introduce soldiers to activities that serve as alternatives to aberrant behaviors often associated with accidents involving recently re-deployed soldiers. This tool presents coping outlets to help soldiers realize their own new level of normalcy after deployment and move on with their lives. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An investigation into fraudulent activities was turned over to me after three other independent investigators did not satisfy the leadership of the results. A joint team from the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) and the Department of Defense Inspector General (DODIG) conducted the previous investigation prior to my involvement. The DCIS and DODIG did not pursue the investigation, as they only calculated a $25,000 fraud committed, which was below their threshold of $100,000. The DCIS and DODIG started their investigation in April 2015 up to the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2015. A whistleblower came forward in March 2015 by one of the employees who worked side by side with the contractor and his staff in the same office at the MWR Director’s building. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How my team calculated $611K loss due to fraud </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">My team and I conducted research of the program and found out it started overseas in January 2013.  I requested information from the MWR director, a primary POC for the investigation, and the chief of finance and accounting department, whose office was in the headquarters. I requested three years (January 1, 2013–September 30, 2015) of computer/system-generated GPC purchases; all key supporting documents (KSDs), including vendors’ invoices and WAQ attendance rosters; and three years of GPC purchase journals from six geographically separated GPC cardholders. Boxes and boxes of KSDs arrived in our office and I distributed each year of transactions to three members of my auditor staff. I tasked them to examine each day of purchases and KSDs, then note discrepancies and suspicious transactions, and reconcile their Excel worksheets with the computer-generated printout and the journals from the six cardholders.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Data analytics is of utmost importance in any financial fraud investigation. Here were the major red flags: </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Collusion and bribery between the MWR outdoor activities chief and the contractor were the major causes of fraud.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>$110,024.93:</strong></span> In 2013, MWR chief of outdoor activities requested funding from San Antonio HQs in Texas for the paintball equipment and supplies in the amount of $110,024.93 EFT to the contractor’s local bank account. Upon examination of the contract, the contractor was personally responsible for the equipment set up and supplies. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>$240,385.00:</strong></span> Group discount for WAQ outdoor activities typically costs $40 per sport and $50 for other sports. These sports included rock-climbing, bungie jumping, ATV, zipline, white water rafting, skiing and paintball. The contractor charged $60 and $70 per soldier attendee. Group discounts collected by the contractor for the three-year period totaled $240,385.00. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>$168,595.95:</strong></span> The contractor and his staff were provided access to the soldiers’ database for all military, families, and Department of the Army (DA) civilian employees and their families. The contractor and his staff inflated attendees, forged signatures, or provided copies of attendance rosters and changed the dates of events, amounting to $168,595.95. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>$73,351.01:</strong></span> GPC requests for payment that did not have any signed rosters totaled $73,351.01. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>$18,959.52:</strong></span><strong> </strong>Uncovering a number of ghost outdoor bus trips was the result of meeting a retired soldier, who was in the same building as our office, during a smoke break. I learned that for geographical bachelors (senior and junior enlisted soldiers without family with them and lived in the barracks), they cannot drive locally. So, the only transportation that is available is two MWR tour buses; the chief of transportation was directed to provide MWR trips for these soldiers. We received 257 PDF files, converted those files into 42 Excel pages, sorted by days and months, and reconciled that data with the Excel payments worksheet. A total of $18,959.52 in fake attendance rosters were paid, but there were no outdoor activities that took place on those dates.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A total of <strong>$611,316.41</strong> in fraudulent payments was made to the contractor, which was way above the $25,000 calculated by the joint team of the DCIS and DoDIG, and far exceeded the $100,000 threshold. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Non-financial information (NFI) is as crucial as the financial information in fraud detection. </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Here is some of the financial information that was crucial and highly contributed to the success of the investigation:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Location Set-Up</strong></span>: The chief of the MWR Outdoor Activities office was on the second level of the building. He had three staffers, and their office was on the first level. The contractor and his three staff were also located at the first level and worked side by side, so there was no segregation of duties and accountabilities. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The Appearance of Same Team</strong></span>: The contractor bought Starbucks coffee and breakfast pastries for all, treated all lunches occasionally and bought matching winter outfits for everyone. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>MWR Chief Approved All GPC Requests for Payment:</strong></span> The contractor had all GPC requests approved by the chief. He had a handheld card reader and would go to all the different local national (LN) GPC cardholders and collect payments. LN cardholders had no choice but to pay the contractor as all GPC requests were already signed/approved by the chief. LNs did not question their authority. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Christmas Holidays:</strong></span> Most of the soldiers went home to their families during Christmas. However, the attendance rosters presented were the same number as during the summertime. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Summer vs. Winter:</strong></span> ATVs, white water rafting, zipline, and other sports are popular in summertime but not normally happening during wintertime. However, they were shown to have “occurred” during unusual times. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Trends and Patterns:</strong></span> We plugged in the fraud trend that started within three months of the program in 2013, which increased through the end of 2013, and peaked in 2014. Fraud significantly declined after the whistleblowing in March 2015. The joint investigation conducted by the DCIS and DoDIG teams covered the investigation after the whistleblower and did not start from the inception of the WQA program in January 2013.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the above case, the detailed analysis of each financial transaction, the trend and pattern of the fraud activities, the time or season of the year for those outdoor activities, and the discovery of ghost bus outdoor movements from casual conversations were critical in the detection of fraud committed. The long hours of interviews with the whistleblower, employees, other MWR chiefs and the MWR director, as well as the help of the accounting and finance department staff and my team made it all a successful fraud investigation.</p>

157,"<h1>Old Tactics, New Landscape</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>By: Bruce Dorris, J.D., CFE, CPA</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We get them every day, multiple times a day. Most contain misspelled words that easily reveal the emails are fake. But that’s not the case with all of them. I’ve seen plenty of sham emails and advertisements that look authentic and made me think twice before deleting them. CFEs have a good eye for these scams and can usually spot them quickly. But sometimes the language and graphics are so convincing that they fool even the most skilled observer.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group, recently pulled off one of the biggest cryptocurrency thefts of all time using just such a technique. This issue’s cover article — “Fraud and the North Korean cyberthreat,” by Patrick Westerhaus, CFE — illustrates that fraudsters can trick even the best and brightest using rogue emails or advertisements.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The financial ecosystem may be getting more complex, but fraudsters are still using basic social engineering tactics to give them access to computer systems. It’s simple deception, perhaps. But it’s effective, and con artists have been using similar methodologies since time immemorial.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What’s new, however, is how these skilled manipulators navigate what’s an ever-changing cyberworld and one that brings new challenges for fraud investigators. Cybercriminals may not be completely invisible, but they operate at much faster speeds than “traditional” fraudsters. They can deplete an organization’s digital coffers in seconds. That’s breathtaking when you consider that the median duration of a fraud — the typical time between when a fraud begins and when it’s detected — is 12 months, according to <a href=""https://acfepublic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2022+Report+to+the+Nations.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><em>Occupational Fraud 2022: A Report to the Nations</em></a>.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To make matters worse, cryptocurrency tumblers or mixers — a service that allows fraudsters to make anonymous digital transactions even more anonymous — raise the stakes and increase the challenges for CFEs trying to trace these illicit funds. These advances demonstrate why it’s so important to build up our internal controls, especially IT, and train our staff accordingly. When it comes to internal controls, we must fully equip ourselves because these criminals know where our vulnerabilities are. As Westerhaus writes, “Criminals get away with so much fraud because no one is watching closely enough to correlate what they’re seeing.” </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Our mission of training CFEs to understand the mindset of this new type of fraudster is more critical than ever. “Cyberfraud is all about the human behavior of criminals and victims,” says Westerhaus. The better we understand cybercrime and the people who perpetrate such frauds, the better job we can do to prevent it.</p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Alexandre De Genaro, CFE, realized he was on the right path when he garnered his first confession during a fraud investigation. After spending time in information security and loss prevention, De Genaro is now the Head of Business Security, Latin America for General Mills.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become passionate about fighting fraud?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I was supporting the global investigation team in a local incident, and I got my first confession. It was a case involving a senior logistics manager with more than 15 years at the company. He borrowed a large amount from one of the carrier’s providers but was unable to pay and eventually reported. With the necessary elements, we obtained his confession, but that was very striking for me. I had not yet come across a case of conflict of interest at this level, especially in the private sector where there was not much publicity in the media. That's when I started to research and understand the potential for losses and the pain caused to businesses, which, without proper attention, could be severely compromised.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you get to your current role? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I am a lawyer, and I started working with information security for a telecommunications company, dealing with breach of confidentiality, telephone interception, and helping law enforcement in investigations of greater offensive potential. After a few years at the head of this department, I received an offer to be the loss prevention manager of an electronic equipment assembly company. I learned that a strong reactive program (research) is an essential part of prevention—after all, even if the deviation is not initially identified, when the corrective action is effective, it ends up generating a preventive culture.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This concept made me give the necessary emphasis to the subject and seek training and improvement in this sector.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What are challenges you face in your role?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In addition to the most common ones, such as lack of structure and organizational culture, I can say that certain investigations reach hierarchical levels that become an enormous political challenge. Aligning expectations within the business itself is also a challenge. The sense of necessity and the way to investigate, but mainly the weight that a fraudulent action has, varies greatly from country to country, from culture to culture, and even from team to team. What is normal practice for the sales team may be unacceptable for the finance team, for example. This creates a challenge, not just for the company, but also an internal challenge for each decision maker.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In my particular case, leading the investigation, I seek clarification of the facts in an impartial way so that the business can make the best decision, but this exemption needs to be set aside when I act as member of the company's compliance committee.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is an important lesson you’ve learned in your career?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Be very careful where you step. It may feel firm—it may even be firm—but it's best to touch your toes before jumping into unfamiliar terrain. The evidence can lead you to logical conclusions, but, in general, there are gaps that, if we are not attentive, can be filled improperly. It is important to be very clear about the division between facts and presumption so that we do not create lines of reasoning based on false premises.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I also learned the value of having a program with training, periodic reports to senior management, review of the company's code of conduct, business involvement in the most conflicting issues, and the importance of the collegiate decision and the Ethics and Compliance Committee, especially with the diversity across sectors.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Finally, I learned that patience and respect for the organization's rhythm are fundamental to the application of a solid and effective program. Trust and culture change are obtained with a lot of resilience, impartiality and transparency, but it is also necessary to understand that this takes time to achieve.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is important to you about being a CFE?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Being a CFE brought me the necessary rationale to authenticate methods, tactics and techniques that I learned and improved along this path. However, I need to highlight the importance of the strategic planning vision for the Fraud, Investigations and Compliance Program that certification makes you understand, plan and apply.</p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As experienced fraud examiners know, fraud comes in many varieties, including tales that are truly frightening. These fraudsters were willing to play any type of trick to take their ill-begotten treats.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Read on to learn more about this year’s tales of terrifying fraud, but don’t say we didn’t warn you.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Six Feet Deep</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A stolen Mercedes Benz filled with bags of unused concrete was discovered on October 20, 2022 in the yard of a multimillion-dollar home linked to one of San Joaquin County's largest-ever insurance fraud schemes in the 1990s, Atherton Mayor Rick DeGolia said. <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/10/22/car-buried-california-human-remains-fraud/10575888002/"">Cadaver dogs alerted</a> to possible human remains more than 24 hours after technicians with the San Mateo County Crime Lab began excavating the car, but none had been found.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Casting Spells and Illusions</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In 2002, Serhat Gumrukcu performed a magic act in which a cane appeared to levitate, and he was introduced as a medical student, using the stage name ""Dr. No"". A little more than a decade later, after coming to the United States, he was involved in multimillion-dollar oil and real-estate deals. Yet his best-known venture was in medicine. For a time, he drew special notice from the government's top infectious disease official, Anthony Fauci. In America, the magician found a new audience for his ideas about groundbreaking treatments.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Enochian Biosciences, co-founded in 2018 by Mr. Gumrukcu, paid more than $21 million to companies controlled by him and his husband for consulting, research and the licensing of potential drugs to treat influenza, hepatitis B, HIV and Covid-19.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">However, this was yet another illusion cast by Dr. No. Despite his claims to represent a Turkish medical association, prosecutors allege that Mr. Gumrukcu misrepresented himself and his credentials in various business dealings. Prosecutors now allege that Mr. Gumrukcu arranged the murder of a business associate, Gregory Davis, <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/biotech-wizard-left-a-trail-of-fraudprosecutors-allege-it-ended-in-murder-11656339183"">who threatened to expose him as a fraud</a>.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Bringing the Dead Back to Life Through Fraud</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Throughout history, the act of grave-robbing has typically provided bandits with, alongside mounds of real dirt, a quick hit of pay dirt. Traditionally, a thief willing to roll up his sleeves and break a sweat might be rewarded with a fistful of jewelry or a stray gold tooth filling. However, in India, fraudsters have taken the concept of grave-robbing to a whole new level—quite literally--as they’ve moved operations above ground. What’s more troubling is the fact that now many of the victims being targeted aren’t even dead.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the Indian state of Assam, and, more specifically, the district of Barpeta, fraud <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-07-01/life-insurance-fraud-swept-through-rural-india"">has emerged</a> as a uniquely vexing problem for local law enforcement. From banking bribes to Ponzi schemes, the whole region has regrettably produced a plethora of fraud, thanks in no small part to economic hardship and widespread unemployment. However, insurance fraud has taken on a life of its own, or, perhaps more accurately, a death—several, in fact. The catch is, many of the “deceased” upon whom claims have been filed are not, in fact, dead. Some were never alive in the first place.</p>

161,<h1>Why the U.K. Should Follow the U.S.'s Whistleblowing Lead</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Tony McClements </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Whistleblowing can be a testy subject, but I believe it is potentially one of the most powerful weapons in our anti-money laundering (AML) arsenal. Anyone watching countless cop shows and movies will be all too aware of the value that an insider brings to an investigation. In the U.K., these “snouts,” as they’re called, are treated very differently than their U.S. counterparts. In the U.S., whistleblowers can stand to make a lot of money from their disclosure.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The U.S. <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) </a>provides an insight into the difference: </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>“The Commission is authorized by Congress to provide monetary awards to eligible individuals who come forward with high-quality original information that leads to a Commission enforcement action in which over $1,000,000 in sanctions is ordered. The range for awards is between 10% and 30% of the money collected.”</em> </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This notion of incentivizing the whistleblower process does not sit comfortably in the U.K. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I have long advocated for the U.K. to follow the U.S. model. Anybody who makes the decision to embark upon becoming a whistleblower knows that it will likely cause irreparable damage to both their current and future career.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Unfortunately, this can serve to mute whistleblowers. They are not cowards, merely realists. Having families to feed and bills to pay is a heady consideration. In the U.S., whistleblowers can at least have some confidence that if their information leads to a successful prosecution, they may be rewarded. There is a risk versus reward element to their decision, unlike here in the U.K. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Some of the whistleblowing rewards in the United States are, of course, eye watering. In <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-177"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2021</span></a>, the SEC passed the $1 billion dollar threshold for rewards made, including a payment that year exceeding $110 million. I am not advocating that a U.K. system should precisely mirror that in the U.S. — merely that we should be able to formulate more realistic rewards that will justify an individual’s decision to whistle blow, enabling them to make that risk versus reward judgment about the impact on their career.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Could rewarding whistleblowers encourage malicious reporting for profit? In my experience and view, such instances are rare, and the outcome is unlikely to result in a prosecution or sanction. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Those reading this article will likely be steeped in the regulated systems that form the foundation for AML and anti-corruption efforts. They may also consider themselves, by default, to be a potential target for a malicious whistleblower. I see Money Laundering Reporting Officers (MLROs) as being akin to “deputized” law enforcement officers. Their role may see them called upon to make decisions not unlike those made by police officers.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I believe it is the fear of malicious whistleblowing that has been at the heart of the U.K.’s resistance to the U.S. model. However, the <a href=""https://www.law360.co.uk/commercial-litigation-uk/articles/1536354/royal-bank-of-canada-beats-whistleblowing-suit"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">recent case involving the Royal Bank of Canada</span></a> in London should go some way to assuaging these concerns. In this instance, a whistleblower at the bank claimed they had been “managed out” of the organisation because they had passed information to the regulator, alleging constructive dismissal. An employment tribunal, however, found no basis in fact and dismissed the case. Bear in mind that this was merely a constructive dismissal case -- not a hearing that could lead to multi-million-dollar fines or even prosecutions leading to culprits being incarcerated. This result goes to the core of my argument. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The fact that the respective thresholds for fines or convictions are set so high means that only those who have committed wrongdoing should be concerned by allegations of this type. Before anyone asserts that this is an easy notion for me to voice (as these possibilities will never apply to me), I should point out that, in the police service, we were all subject to malicious complaints every day of the year. Only those who were guilty lost any sleep. <br/>
The point I am seeking to make is that incentivizing whistleblowers is only a bad thing if their allegations are unfounded in fact and unsupported by corroborative evidence. In effect, the U.K. needs to accept that some malicious, ill-founded allegations are likely. But nobody has anything to worry about unless they have erred, given the safety measures in place in the form of investigation and evidential thresholds. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Unfortunately, the current status quo in the U.K. is more likely to allow the crooked to get away with the frauds and malpractice we all want to see exposed. We should not continue to oppose a system that is designed to help us rid the world of such corrupt individuals. Neither should we continue to reject the notion that whistleblowing deserves rewards simply because someone may occasionally make an unfounded accusation. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The whole ethos of the U.K.’s position regarding whistleblowing needs to be reconsidered. Directors and CEOs of organizations operating in the regulated sector need to accept that at some stage they will be subject to a complaint, and that their MLRO <em>should be supported</em> until such time as there is a failure to be addressed—just like the police. </p>

162,<h1>The Certified Fraud Examiner Seeks to Prove Reality</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Marlon Balogh, CFE, MS-FA </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Reality is simply based in fact, whether it be an event or transaction. A fraudster’s movement is a documented reality. Reality, or the truth, is simply confirmed by documentation, digital footprints and verifiable eyewitnesses, which can be pieced together to reveal the factual timeline. This has now become a natural law in a technologically driven society where a person’s movements, swipes, likes, interests and all other relevant personal metadata is collected to identify an individual. Similarly, transactions are digitally documented, as is an entity’s statements, claims and societal influence. Fraudsters are aware of such circumstances and, therefore, attempt to augment the perception of reality and fact surrounding the perpetration of fraud. Simply put, a fraudster will always be actively in the process of concealment. Fortunately for forensic accountants, such a task is prone to errors and holes, leaving behind trails of evidence to piece together.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The duty of a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) and those engaged to determine indicia of fraud is to seek out facts that illustrate the reality supported by evidence. This evidence, though, must be enough to bring the fraudster’s augmented reality back to a fact-based timeline of events. What is meant by “fact based timeline” in forensic accounting and fraud examination and how does a CFE determine an appropriate level of evidence to determine the facts?</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The CFE or engaged professional should consider a timeline, a visual demonstration, as a base for developing the full story for effective understanding of financial events as it is supported by documentation. This approach offers guidance, eliminating false narrative, and instead replacing it with a fact-based, evidence-supported, comparative timeline of events.                         </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Obtaining the Right Evidence</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Concealment is a full-time job for a fraud perpetrator. First-time fraudsters are often worried and anxious whether their scheme will be identified, unless one has sociopathic characteristics. Quite often, the fraudster becomes tired of concealment and, once relaxed, the fraud is discovered by a fellow co-worker, manager or even client. In the matter of kiting schemes, once a perpetrator sets off for a vacation after years of concealing a fraud, suddenly an overlooked and outstanding bill is no longer considered “paid,” toppling the house of cards built over the period of concealment.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It is not likely that a fraud can last forever; it’s quite an undertaking to manage on a regular basis. This leaves the fraudster prone to errors and mistakes. Fraudsters are often tech savvy and intelligent people who can augment receipts, documentation, bank statements and checks using simple editing tools that are readily available on office computers, such as Adobe, free open-source software, and Microsoft Paint and Word. This is considerably important when determining what is a reliable source of documentation and evidence. Documents received from the accused should always be compared to a third-party source such as banks, financial institutions, vendors or other related third parties. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Determining the appropriate evidence is affected by the type of scheme, size and breadth of the fraud perpetrated. These factors determine the level of detail, work and scope the CFE is required to complete to obtain enough evidentiary details and information. So, what is sufficient to support a fact-based timeline? Sufficient evidence for a CFE is either evidence that thoroughly determines and states fact, or a large enough volume of evidence to ensure that fact can be relied upon, illustrated and explained. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A single piece of evidence that is sufficient to determine fact is evidence from an unbiased, uncoerced and reliable third party, which details facts that may confirm a tested detail. To elaborate further, a tested detail is a partial story line or claim tested against provided documentation. For instance, a fraudster may claim that $500 on a specific date was used for a utility expense. When tested, the $500 was not supported by a receipt but was confirmed to be transferred to a personal bank account. Further testing of the personal account also confirmed that no such utility expense was paid for or identified. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The CFE must, of course, have a starting point to test claims and, therefore, the CFE determines the nature and environment in which the perpetrator acts. A trained CFE can determine the general documentation required to begin their investigation based on the industry and known procedures, practices and processes. Preliminary knowledge of the industry, during a discovery phase, allows the CFE to request documentation and prompts the attorney to file subpoenas. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As documentation arrives, the CFE promptly begins analysis that narrows the facts, taking from the documentation all relevant information with a level of detail that properly supports the analysis and whether there is indicia of fraud or not. For instance, data such as receipts, email chains with vendors, bank statements and cashed checks should all support a narrative that is completed. Simply put, a story must have a beginning, middle and end. Without this natural progression, the story is incomplete.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An important detail for a CFE is to visually complete a timeline of events of the fraud perpetrated, supported by the evidence attached directly to the timeline. Such demonstrations allow its users to adequately understand the timeframe in conjunction with evidence, portraying the scheme as it unfolded. This type of demonstration has proven quite effective within the courtroom as it guides the attorneys and displays complex accounting in a palpable, easily understood manner. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In a similar light, a CFE may not be able to state that all evidence supports a conclusion of indicia of fraud if there are missing pieces, such as the transactions identified in bank statements, receipts or checks. What could be said is that there is potential of concealment and that additional work is required to complete an analysis to reach a conclusion of indicia of fraud. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">CFEs face a challenge of limited information, but with enough documentation may conclude on the indicia of fraud and support a complete narrative.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A Second Obstacle: Combatting Confirmation Bias</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">CFEs as individuals are not perfect and often face their own internalized challenge of confirmation bias. For instance, once an engagement is presented and base details of the suspected fraud are provided, an inexperienced or compromised CFE may generate a preconception of unsupportable details or draw preliminary conclusions regarding type of fraud, process and concealment methods prior to any review of reliable documentation. This behavior, either based on instinct or a compromising relationship with clients, often leads the CFE to test the evidence in a particularly biased manner (i.e., they may only want to review documentation that supports their opinion of fraud and avoid looking at documentation that may contradict or disprove their notion). CFEs must learn early in their careers to maintain an unbiased approach and in spite of professional relationships with clients. By ignoring documentation that could potentially alter the conclusions of any analysis performed, such work burdens attorneys and especially those accused of wrongdoing.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A deeper version of confirmation bias that is not often spoken of, but exists within the industry, is the misapplication of the forensic approach, steps and procedures. For instance, a knowledgeable and seasoned, but biased, CFE may choose to apply a damages-based approach to a fraud matter if it could narrate a different story and prove indicia of fraud (or not) in a case that would require procedures for embezzlement and theft. This application would offset the total amount of monies embezzled or stolen in the favor of the perpetrator. While this is an oversimplification, confirmation bias can not only be evidence based but could also be completed at the engagement level following inappropriate design and procedures on an engagement. An unbiased CFE may also fall victim to improperly applying procedures and considering themselves as creative in technique and approach, not realizing the misapplication of procedures. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Such knowledge allows the CFE or expert witness to instead argue the difference of approach in court as it may differ from the opposing forensic expert. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">CFEs that are opposing biased application of technique and standards should be aware of strategies to also augment the nature of the fraud scheme. The biased CFE is likely to narrate an expert report that lessens or heightens the severity of a scheme depending on which side their bias resides.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Ultimate Timeline Test</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Returning to the demonstrative timeline, on which we base our understanding of the events that occurred during the suspected perpetration of fraud, allows each CFE to ground themselves in an unbiased reality. Each moment on the timeline should be well documented, supported and completed with attached exhibits and supportable documentation for each event illustrated. Documentation should be tested, corroborated with appropriate parties and only then reported and evidenced within the working analysis. Such thorough processes eliminate the possibility of falsified documentation entering the relied upon support and, instead, ensures that the CFE’s demonstrative accurately records and displays for its users only fact. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While the topic evidence is not detailed in its complexity, its gravity on matters regarding fraud examination and forensic accounting ensures that CFEs only report fact and not opinion. The industry only serves to benefit from reliable documentation and therefore so does the judicial system with its use of CFEs. </p>

163,<h1>ACFE Launches Government Resources Hub Highlighting Focused Trainings and Resources</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) is excited to announce a new resource focused on aiding anti-fraud professionals working alongside government entities at local, state, national and international levels to continue enhancing their fraud-fighting toolkits. </p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">“The challenges anti-fraud professionals working for government organizations experience are similar to those faced in any industry, broadly speaking; namely, adapting quickly to evolving business operations and fraud vulnerabilities,” says Mason Wilder, Research Manager at the ACFE. “Fraudsters are adapting their tactics more quickly than ever to fit new government benefit programs and constantly hunting for new vulnerabilities to exploit. If government organizations aren’t taking proactive approaches to managing fraud risks, they are going to suffer worse fraud impacts from evolving fraud schemes.” </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This new home for government fraud resources includes a collection of articles published in <em>Fraud Magazine</em> and <em>ACFE Insights</em>, episodes of the <em>Fraud Talk</em> podcast and infographics detailing the latest findings discovered in <a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2022/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>Occupational Fraud 2022: A Report to the Nations</em></span></a>.

164,"<h1>Member Spotlight: Sherene Teo, CFE</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Sherene Teo, CFE, began her career in anti-fraud as an auditor in China and after encouragement she applied to become an in-house investigator which helped her gain experience to join her new team at Microsoft. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become passionate about fighting fraud?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I have worked in China and have witnessed first-hand highly creative fraud practices as an auditor. I was intrigued with the way things were done and it helped build my skepticism and experience as a professional. Born in Malaysia and seeing how Malaysians were affected by the 1MDB saga, it made me realize the importance of the work I do and the impact it has on the community. Fraud benefits no one, especially in the public sector, and those who suffer are innocent victims. Whether directly or indirectly, I feel that what I do every day contributes to the community in a meaningful way.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you get to your current role? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In-house investigators were not very popular ten years ago in Asia. The situation is vastly different today, and in-house investigators are in greater demand. There is even a lack of investigators in the Asia region and MNCs are struggling to fill these roles. When I first started my role as an investigator, I was fortunate to be working for Cisco Systems, a technology organization that encourages job rotation. Human Resources approached me and encouraged me to apply for an internal investigations’ role. I went ahead with the application and was successful, and consequently I have not looked back. Being in that role for almost eight years and in that organization for eleven years, I decided to challenge myself and ventured out of my comfort zone to try something different. Currently, I work for Microsoft, another great technology organization doing what I enjoy. As a company that encourages growth mindset and innovation, I recently even had an opportunity to join a Hackathon!</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What are challenges you face in your role?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Working in a technology organization with various business units and sales processes translates to a steep learning curve. Each case I have taken on has been unique in its own way and this has helped to broaden and expand my experience – plus it helps a lot when the work is exciting and fun!</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is an important lesson you’ve learned in your career?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud professionals come from various backgrounds, i.e., consulting, finance, public services, armed forces, law enforcement etc. Hence, we can learn from anyone with varying degrees of experience and knowledge. One of the most important skills to have as an investigator is also observation and listening skills, and to respect your interviewees by providing them with the opportunity to explain themselves. Possessing an open mind and sticking to the facts is also another important thing to bear in mind. Investigators should also be aware of unconscious bias and take steps to prevent that. On top of being fraud fighters on your work desk, it is important to build on people skills and have empathy when dealing with senior management and employees. I try to understand the motive behind any actions and put myself in that employee’s shoes. This has led me to uncover some of the biggest frauds in the company I’ve worked for. Lastly, Asia is a diverse mix of cultures and understanding the different cultures when conducting investigations is important for an effective investigation.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is important to you about being a CFE?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Before deciding whether to take up the CFE certification, I looked up the qualifications required for fraud-related job openings on LinkedIn. All the job openings for fraud-related vacancies require the CFE certification. This convinced me to start the CFE certification process and since then, it has added immense value and credibility to my personal career. At an Asia event, I even had the chance to meet Tom Wright, author of the Billion Dollar Whale. Since attaining the CFE certification, it has given me an edge in the anti-fraud profession and allows me to network with fellow ACFE members when attending conferences and training.

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Eddie Antar founded the Crazy Eddie electronics retail chain in Brooklyn, New York, which rose to prominence across the New York-New Jersey area throughout the 1970s. Operating undetected for years, Eddie’s business practices were grounded in fraud from the very beginning. In Episode 124 of <em>Fraud Talk</em>, Gary Weiss, author of “Retail Gangster: The Insane, Real-Life Story of Crazy Eddie,” discusses this wide-ranging fraud case and ultimate unraveling with ACFE Chief Training Officer John Gill, J.D., CFE.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In this excerpt from <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/podcast/podcast-detail?s=september-2022-crazy-eddie"">episode 124</a>, John Gill and Gary Weiss talk about the insurance scheme Eddie committed but was never caught for.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Gill</strong>: It was like, well, if he had a water leak, why not take advantage of that? Let's get some of this merchandise that we can't sell, we'll put it down. There's like, well, if it wasn't enough water still left, they would get a hose out and they would hose it down. Here's a quote I like from the book, it says, ""Eddie had limits when it came to insurance fraud. He never started a fire in one of his stores, never faked a robbery, or sabotaged his own plumbing.""</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Some would remember how furious Eddie was when he learned about a fire that occurred in one of the other stores. It's like, he didn't torch the place. What got him mad was not that the plant burned down, but that his partner hadn't insured it for fire damage. They missed out on spiking enhanced windfall. Its like, well, if it had burned down, they could have claimed all this extra merchandising and insurance proceeds, but it didn't take out any insurance coverage on it.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It was interesting to me that that was his line. It's like, ""Well I'm not going to break the pipe on purpose, that would be wrong,"" but if the pipe happens to break, then he saw nothing wrong with throwing all the merchandise he could possibly fit in the basement down in the basement to collect on the covers. It's such an odd line to me that he seemed to take pride that he-- ""Well, I didn't commit insurance fraud really, because I didn't break the pipe, I just happened to-- a few extra boxes fell in, huh, so be it.""</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Weiss: </strong>Yes. They used to call it spiking the claim. You got a claim, let's make the most of it. In fact, he used to keep water-locked merchandise that he had previously submitted for claims. He used to keep them in a special warehouse, and then he'd throw them out. Not only would he bring poor-selling merchandise and dump it in the basement if there was a flood or whatever, but he'd take a merchandise that he previously had submitted for claims that were these moldy boxes and he dumped the moldy boxes in.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">He had a crooked insurance adjuster working with him. You really need an insurance adjuster in those types of commercial claim. He had his crooked insurance adjuster who he paid under the table and who would, in turn, pay the other guy under the table. He was never caught for that. In fact, what seemed remarkable about Eddie is that he wasn't caught for the majority of the crimes that he committed. Not for the insurance fraud, which was blatant. The warrant of claims were part of his initial criminal complaint, so it was kind, but it was not big.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">He was never really caught up short for the warranty claims. The sales tax fraud was really significant. It was a big, big money maker. Back in the '70s, when he was doing this, he started to do this by '70s and '80s, it was so much crime going on in New York City of all kinds, that it just was part of the background noise of crime in New York at the time. That's one of the reasons he was able to get away with it. That, and I think the fact that he didn't, as you point out, he didn't deliberately rob his own stores or create conditions, he just took advantage of them.</p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Ryan Cannon is an undergraduate student studying at the University at Albany and also a proud past recipient of the ACFE’s <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/scholarship.aspx"">Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship</a>. Ryan is pursuing a dual major in Homeland Security and Business Administration. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you hear about the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship and what made you decide to apply?   </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As a dual major in Homeland Security and Business Administration, I discovered the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship while having a discussion about my career aspirations with my father, who is a CFE. I strongly believe that the scholarship is closely tied to my career objectives in both fields of study. As a recipient, I am thankful that the scholarship will assist me in becoming a valuable member of the global fraud fighting community. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become passionate about fighting fraud? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">My passion about fraud fighting is derived from the intersection of my two fields of study at the University at Albany. I am pursuing a challenging and unique dual major in both Homeland Security, Cybersecurity, and Emergency Preparedness, and Business Administration.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Each degree at first appeared to be independent, but I grew to understand how closely they align. I am personally intrigued with the practicalities of business and the financial fraud schemes that continue to threaten many aspects of our daily lives, country and world. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What advice do you have for students who are interested in applying for the scholarship? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud is pervasive in organizations across the world. So, I encourage all to apply, as we are all fraud fighters. Furthermore, as students, the scholarship opportunities may open your eyes to new perspectives and possibly introduce you to a new cutting-edge field of interest. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This past June, I volunteered as an intern at the ACFE Global Fraud Conference in Nashville. I strongly recommend students, whether or not a scholarship recipient, to apply as an intern or attend the conference. The perspectives of the session presenters and networking opportunities were an eye-opening experience. It provided me with an early insight to the vastness of the fraud fighting profession and the numerous career possibilities that are open to young fraud fighters. </p>

167,<h1>Unethical Actions of Russian Energy Companies Are Rattling the Marketplace</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Syed Zubair Ahmed, CFE </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The backbone of the Russian economy is energy exports. The Russian energy sector is an enormous global asset driving economic activity across the world. In 2021, Russian crude and condensate output reached 10.5 million barrels per day, making up <a href=""https://www.iea.org/articles/energy-fact-sheet-why-does-russian-oil-and-gas-matter"">14% of the world’s total supply</a>. In the same year, Russia exported oil worth USD 300 billion, accounting for 11% of the global oil trade.  The country exports most of its oil production, with almost all going to Europe (about 80%) and Asia (about 20%). Russia has the world’s largest proven crude oil reserves, totaling almost 264 billion barrels as of January 2021. The country also has the second largest proven natural gas reserves in the world, totaling about 1,688 trillion cubic feet as of the same date. The country’s oil and gas sector accounts for more than 50% of its GDP and more than 70% of its export. As the world’s largest oil producer, Russia has a major impact on global oil markets. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Russian entrepreneurs have found a new and ingenious way to manipulate the Russian economy—through the use of their oil and gas wealth. In particular, they rely on natural gas and oil prices to determine their profit margins, which in turn gives them a lot of power over the country's oligarchs. This practice has led to rampant corruption, including political bribery or setting up front companies, as the energy companies keep enriching themselves at the expense of the Russian people. The abusive practices of the Russian energy sector have caused a public outcry in Europe and America, with some politicians calling for sanctions on Russia, as allegations have been raised throughout both the public and private sectors in the country.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The recent, shocking surge in fake Russian oil sales has generated a great deal of confusion and speculation. Some believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to undermine the West by selling oil at a discount, while others suggest that he is stockpiling oil to create an artificial shortage and bolster prices in the event of a global crisis. It is impossible to know for sure what Putin’s motivations are, but it is important to be aware of the danger that these fake sales pose. The <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00969-9"">reason for this surge in fake Russian oil sales</a> is still unknown, but many experts believe that it is due to the deteriorating situation in Ukraine. The fighting has caused a sharp decrease in the production of crude oil and shale gas, which is the main source of income for Russian energy companies. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, these fake oil sellers are Russian energy companies, which are very keen to steal profits, as they know that the current oil market is currently unstable. These companies are often associated with corrupt officials and, as such, pose a threat to national security. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Several major players remain in the Russian oil industry in recent years. Russia's top oil producer is state-owned Rosneft. It is followed by Lukoil, which is the largest privately owned oil company in the country. Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegaz, Tatneft and Russneft also have significant holdings in the Russian oil industry. These five Russian energy companies represent how the nation's oil and gas industry is dominated by state forces. A post-Soviet group of companies, they all operate similarly and are closely intertwined, with one executive today even being accused of stealing more than $5 billion from his firm. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">According to a report by The Financial Times, Rosneft was manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the global benchmark interest rate in a scheme that may have contributed to the financial crisis of 2007–08. LIBOR is used as a benchmark to set the rates for trillions of dollars worth of loans worldwide, so any manipulation of the rate can have serious consequences for the stability of the global financial system.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As it turns out, mostly relying on natural gas and oil prices to determine their profit margins, the manipulation by Russian energy companies has led to wasteful spending on projects that have little to no benefit for the country as a whole. In 2013, Gazprom transferred 1.4 billion rubles (USD 27 million) from its subsidiary, Rusnano, to a company owned by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Mikhail Abyzov, a former Russian politician and businessman, was arrested in March 2019 on suspicion of embezzling over USD 69 million from a state-owned company. This high-profile arrest of the once-influential Russian politician and businessman sparked public outcry. The arrest came as a surprise to many, as Abyzov was previously close to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Abyzov is known for two things: He was on Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev’s team, but more importantly, he was the chairman of the board of the state-owned Russian electricity grid holding company. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Roman Abramovich could be considered one of the luckiest men in the world. He was born into a family of Jewish immigrants in the Soviet Union and was able to parlay his family's connections into a successful career in the oil industry. <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#19933a813d78"">Russia’s richest man</a> and owner of the Chelsea Football Club, Abramovich's net worth is USD 8.7 billion, and he has been able to amass this fortune through his company, Lukoil, one of the largest oil companies in the world. Unfortunately, Abramovich has been implicated in oil scams, and it has been revealed that his company needs more money because it used rackets to launder money from the people in the Middle East.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Oil companies like Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as aluminum producer Rusal, is subject to political shell games that lead to instability in global markets. This has serious consequences for oil prices and shorter-term commodity prices like copper and aluminum, which was seen recently with a sharp sell-off in those stocks on Wall Street. The reason for this price drop is that Russia's energy companies are dumping their bad news into the market by dumping billions upon billions of dollars worth of shares onto the public markets over the last several months. Most of this came following sanctions imposed on Russia by western governments across Europe (more specifically Germany) after Putin annexed Crimea from Ukraine. It’s the first-time sanctions of this nature have been imposed on Russian companies. They range from bans on defense exports to outright bans on key oil or gas exports such as Novatek. As per speculations made by investors, Russia's oil industry is going to slow down due to the current economic condition and sanctions imposed on its energy companies.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To seize control of the oil resource, Russian energy companies continue to cheat the system and enrich the privileged. The years-long lull in global oil prices has done little to deter Russia’s thirst for oil. Instead, it has fueled a renewed focus on “unconventional” sources of crude that are becoming more prevalent in the interior and country's vast wilderness. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Over the past decade, Russia has been one of the few nations in the world that haven't been struck by a major oil crisis. But this doesn't mean that Russia isn't worried about oil prices either. Oil has played an important role in Russia's economy and politics for decades, so it's no surprise that when oil prices began to fall rapidly and unexpectedly, the Russian leaders believed that action needed to be taken. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Russian media has been ineffective in helping to uncover the corruption of the Russian government. While it does have a role in spreading propaganda, it is also responsible for disseminating fake news. This is because Russian reporters are often paid to disseminate propaganda rather than report on indisputable facts. This makes it difficult to find accurate information about the Russian government. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It appears that the Russian government has a great need for the oil they produce. It's estimated that they are making USD 27 billion from unethical practices. Although many people think these crimes are just perpetrated by low-level workers, professionals are almost certainly involved in the crimes. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Russia has been able to maintain a stable supply of energy throughout its territory despite extreme winter conditions and poor infrastructure for one reason: the sheer size of its oil reserves. Other countries are unable to keep up with these large reserves because they lack enough cold weather and natural gas to power their economies. The Russian oil industry and its pipelines carry over 90% of all Russian international energy exports. Russia's oil sector has been under scrutiny by Western governments, which have often accused Russia of covering up its arms or conducting underground trade with Iran. The Russian government has mostly denied these allegations and labeled them as propaganda campaigns that are intended to discredit Russia's foreign policy.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The question of whether Russia is going to tighten the control of its economy or strengthen its relations with the West has become a hot topic for many political analysts. With oil prices continuing to decline, the Kremlin has shown signs that it may be more inclined to tighten its control over its economy. However, given Russia’s history of engaging in Eurasianism and its recent achievements in Ukraine, some analysts believe that Russia will instead strengthen its relations with the West. </p>

168,<h1>From Their Plates to Our Pockets — $250 Million Stolen from Pandemic Food Program</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Justice Department charged <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-attorney-announces-federal-charges-against-47-defendants-250-million-feeding-our-future"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">47 defendants</span></a> on September 20th for allegedly defrauding a federal program that provided food for needy children during the pandemic, describing the scheme — totaling nearly $250 million — as the largest uncovered to date. The charges also underscore that criminals have been quick to take advantage of new programs set up by the U.S. government to curb fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, and they’re exploiting weaknesses in systems designed to quickly distribute funds. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The indictments announced Tuesday involve six groups and one individual, all connected to a Minnesota nonprofit called Feeding Our Future. The defendants are charged with federal crimes including conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering and paying or receiving illegal kickbacks. The DOJ alleges that Aimee Bock, the founder of Feeding Our Future in Apple Valley, Minnesota — which actually did serve federally funded meals to underserved kids before the pandemic struck — masterminded the plot. According to the DOJ, Bock recruited other individuals to create websites falsely claiming they were sponsored by her group. The sites purported that donations would be used to feed needy children — but no such donation receipt records could ever be found when federal agents investigated this allegation. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Records show that Feeding Our Future's disbursements grew from approximately $3.4 million in 2019 to nearly $200 million in 2021. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">“This was a brazen scheme of staggering proportions,” said Andrew M. Luger, U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota. “These defendants exploited a program designed to provide nutritious food to needy children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, they prioritized their own greed, stealing more than a quarter of a billion dollars in federal funds to purchase luxury cars, houses, jewelry, and coastal resort property abroad.” </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The theft of $250 million from the food program is a serious crime, but it is also just one more example of how fraud and corruption threaten our world's ability to meet the needs of its people. </p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the fight against fraud, it can be hard to remember why we do it, especially when the fraudsters never seem to quit. Associate professor of accounting, taxation and business law at SUNY Old Westbury, Dr. David Glodstein, began the Justice for Fraud Victims Project to teach his students — and remind fraud examiners — who we're fighting for: the victims. In this episode of <em>Fraud Talk</em>, join Dr. Glodstein, CFE, and Kate Pospisil, CFE, the Communications Specialist at the ACFE, as they discuss the Justice for Fraud Victims Project, why programs like this matter and what we can do to further the fight for justice.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In this excerpt from <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/podcast/podcast-detail?s=august-2022-justice-for-fraud-victims"">episode 123</a>, Kate and Dr. Glodstein speak about how the Justice for Fraud Victims Project benefits underprivileged groups and small businesses, while allowing the next generation of fraud fighters to learn and gain professional experience. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Pospisil: </strong>Do you ever get involved with cases that haven't been litigated yet?</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Glodstein: </strong>Yes. Through the project, we're not trying to take business away from fraud examiners or Forensic accountants, but some people like minority communities, they might not be able to afford the services of a private forensic accountant. When they go to law enforcement, law enforcement might say your case is too small, we don't have the resources to put to that.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A lot of times where do they go? They don't know where to go. This developed as I was doing-- I used to go to various local community events and people wouldn't know who to return to. Do I go to the FBI? Do I go to federal? Do I go to State? Do I go to my local? People just gave up, like $2,000 or $5,000 to a large business that got defrauded might not mean that much, but to a small business entity, that might be the difference between being in business or not being in business.</p>

171,"<h1>90-Day CFE Exam Challenge Success Story: Dr. Tim Klatte, CFE</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">After years of experience leading hundreds of fraud-related investigations, Dr. Tim Klatte, CFE made the decision to prepare for the CFE exam with the help of the 90-Day CFE Exam Challenge. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Why did you join the 90-Day CFE Exam Challenge?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I have been a Forensic Accounting Partner in Shanghai, assisting clients with sensitive risk management matters since 2011. Although I have many years of practical forensic experience and have led hundreds of fraud-related investigations, I never made the time to prepare and pass the CFE. The 90-Day CFE Exam Challenge provided the exact motivation I needed to cross the finish line. I appreciated the community of support and the willingness of the ACFE team to guide me along the way. I joined three of the 90-day challenge webinars and found them extremely useful, gaining nuggets of helpful information in each session. Overall, the challenge allowed me to prepare for the exam with like-minded individuals who shared the same motivation, resulting in a constant stream of encouragement. With the CFE, I have gained credibility in the market and tremendous respect from my peers, who recognize its importance when advising on fraud issues – this would not have been possible without the platform of the 90-Day challenge, steered so well by the ACFE team.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What did your study method look like?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I joined a week-long CFE Review Course in late March, which was an excellent motivation to get me focused on the 90-Day challenge running from April-June. I spent most of April reviewing all content across all sections before concentrating on one section at a time. I passed my first section on May 2nd and then took one section exam per week after that. I created flashcards and took practice exams often, committing 2-3 hours daily to preparing for each section. I maintained a notebook containing critical topics from each section that I had to know – then reviewed it often. I also remained active in the 90-day challenge chat groups and learned from my peers in the areas I found difficult. Finally, I limited my sources to prepare for the exam, as too many sources online provided outdated and sometimes useless noise – I stayed focused on materials from my March review course and the ACFE prep course only. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did the challenge help you accomplish your goal of passing the CFE Exam?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The challenge provided the right motivation I needed to pass the exam. The platform brought together talented professionals from various backgrounds from all over the world (I am based in China!) to encourage each other to achieve our common goal. In the beginning, I didn’t participate so much in the chat forums. Then, one day in early April, I received an email from ACFE mentioning that “<em>Challenge participants who post at least once in the group are two times more likely to pass the exam by the end of the challenge than those who don’t post at all.</em>” This encouraged me to become more active and not only share my story and exam plan with others to be held accountable, but also to support those in the challenge to keep going. The timing of the challenge was perfect, and the preparation and study environment were managed so well by the ACFE team.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What did it feel like when you got the email saying you’d passed? How did you celebrate?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I took each of the four sections about a week apart, and in each one, I received higher scores than expected. I took the most familiar sections to me first, leaving the most difficult one (Law) for last, which gave me more time to prepare and focus. The Prometric online portal for the exam emailed my results within 15 minutes of submitting each test. I was extremely excited to see the passing grade, but most importantly, I was more motivated to press on and look to the next section exam. Each celebration was short; I wanted to stay fixated on the next exam a few days later. When I passed the Law section – I celebrated with my family for an evening out. I also used this success story to serve as a lesson to my children about the importance of focused hard work to achieve a goal. My daughters, 12 and 16, watched me throughout the month’s study hard and then pass all four sections on the first attempt. This example for my kids – to me – was the greatest reward and the best celebration.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What advice do you have for challenge participants who are preparing for the CFE Exam?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Several things come to mind. First, surround yourself with encouraging people who know and appreciate how this certification is important to you. Encouragement from family, colleagues and other challenge participants is a great motivation. Also, schedule the tests early to guarantee the testing day/time you prefer and to push you to focus leading up to each section exam. Having a rigorous schedule to prepare and develop a study strategy will pay off in the end. Third, understand that learning can come in many forms. For me, it was practice tests and flashcards. For others, it might be concept memorization and watching videos. Find the best method for you and know that the ACFE has a plan in place that will work. Trust the process. Finally, keep the big picture in mind, i.e., passing the exam. Some concepts may be challenging to learn during the study process, and some practice test results may not be so high. However, keep a positive outlook and actively learn from the journey. In many cases, you are more ready than you believe – I know I was, as each section exam score exceeded my expectations.</p>

<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Auditing Standards</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Auditing inspections, investigations and enforcement</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Auditor independence </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Accounting standards </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Corporate governance and accountability</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Financial transparency</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Foreign companies</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud prevention</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Whistleblower protections</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">SOX continues to evolve and help assure investors and the general public of the good faith they can place in public companies. However, as fraudsters continue to develop their own tactics, laws, measures and internal controls must always continue developing.  One piece of SOX demonstrates that it is not just words on a page, but it has a deep breadth of influence and interpretability. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Section 304 of Sarbanes-Oxley</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While many companies face various charges from the SEC, one of the less commonly used parts of the SOX Act includes Section 304(a) (commonly referred to as SOX 304), a provision that permits the SEC to order the disgorgement of bonuses and incentive or equity-based compensation earned by the CEO and CFO in the 12 months following the issuance of any financial statement that the issuer is required to restate because of misconduct, and the reimbursement of those funds to the issuer. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">However, in 2009, while the SEC issued a settled enforcement action against CSK Auto Corp. that alleged CSK improperly accounted for vendor allowances and consequently overstated income in 2002, 2003 and 2004, the SEC also first filed to use the provision to clawback compensation in a civil suit from CSK’s former CEO who was not accused of violating any securities law. The district court sided with the SEC, concluding that SOX 304 does not contain a personal liability requirement and that it is the issuer’s misconduct that initiates the clawback provision — that is, CEOs and CFOs do not need to have personally engaged in the misconduct requiring accounting restatements to be liable for the clawback of bonuses and other incentive-based compensation under SOX 304. The court observed that disgorgement under the provision “is merited to prevent corporate officers from profiting from the proceeds of misconduct, whether it is their own misconduct or the misconduct of the companies they are paid to run.”</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In 2016, the SEC declined to pursue reimbursement from the CEO and former CFO of Monsanto after the executives returned cash bonuses and stock awards received during the period of accusations. Additionally in 2016, while charging biopesticide company Marrone Bio Innovations with accounting fraud, and reaching a settlement, the SEC did not charge the company’s executives with any charges related to misconduct.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Under Section 304(b), the SEC is permitted to exempt any person as it deems necessary and appropriate. However, the SEC has not provided any meaningful guidance regarding the factors for such an exemption. As seen with Marrone Bio and Monsnato, the actions suggest that the SEC’s expectation of reimbursement of some forms of compensation, a willingness to forego an enforcement action if reimbursement is made, and a willingness to pursue an enforcement action to compel what the SEC considers appropriate or required reimbursement.                                                                </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In 2021, the SEC charged the former CEO and CFO of WageWorks Inc. with making false and misleading statements and omissions — including to the company’s auditors — which resulted in the company’s improper recognition of revenue related to a contract with a large public-sector client. The SEC then invoked the rarely used SOX 304 to obtain reimbursement of incentive-based compensation earned by the executives. The SEC said that executives should not profit from their, or their company's, misconduct.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In 2022, the SEC charged Synchronoss with accounting fraud and ordered it to pay $12.5 million in penalties. Again, the former CEO was not charged in connection with the company’s fraud but was still required to reimburse the company for over $1.3 million in stock sale profits and bonuses. Again, this demonstrated the SEC’s ability to charge all those responsible for the fraud and include the CEO, though not culpable, for being in an accountable position to prevent the fraud through implementation of stronger internal controls.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">SOX 304 remains a useful, discretionary provision for the SEC. Twenty years from now, we will likely see more changes and interesting applications of all SOX provisions as fraudsters greedily continue to scam, scheme, bamboozle and hustle their way through corporations. </p>

173,<h1>Managing Cognitive Bias in Fraud Investigations</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When investigating fraud, it is important that the investigator be able to think clearly and make unbiased decisions. Cognitive bias is when an investigator's own assumptions or beliefs impact their judgment of information and evidence. For example, an investigator may assume that because someone comes from a certain social class or background that they would not commit fraud. An assumption like this may prevent them from looking at other possible explanations for what happened. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It is important for an investigator to recognize any biases they may have and be aware of how these may impact the investigation. Investigators must: </p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Understand the concept of cognitive bias. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Be aware of how cognitive bias can impact an investigation. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Know how to avoid cognitive bias. </li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Confirmation bias </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Investigators should also be aware that the more they look into something, the more they will find it. This leads to a confirmation bias; investigators develop a hypothesis and then look only for evidence that supports their theory. This has been shown to be especially true in investigations where there is a lack of evidence or conflicting accounts of what happened. It is important to remember that this can skew findings and lead investigators down an unproductive path as they attempt to understand what happened in any given situation. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another problem occurs when investigators rely on their own experiences to make decisions about a certain case, which can cause tunnel vision. Basically, past experiences can lead to a cognitive bias when investigating new information or events. This type of thinking can cause an investigator to miss important details because they don't fit into their preconceived notion. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Seeing patterns </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Investigators tend to see patterns where none exist. When looking at a complex set of data, the investigator might come up with a simple common-denominator explanation that could overlook more likely explanations. To avoid making this mistake as an investigator, consider how well your hypothesis fits with the rest of your evidence before you finalize it in your report. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Permission bias </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Permission bias happens when investigators give too much weight to the opinion of an authority figure, an expert whose opinion they trust. The investigator must decide whether they want their judgment to be influenced by another's opinion. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If you have not had training with a particular tool or method and do not know how to use it, be wary of using that tool or method until you receive proper training for it. By knowing your own skills and limitations and seeking help from those who are more knowledgeable than yourself in specific areas of expertise, investigators can avoid errors due to permission bias during investigations. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Anchoring </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An anchor is a reference point that we use to make sense of ambiguous information. For example, an investigator may estimate an unknown amount using a well-known reference as their anchor point; unfortunately, this may limit their ability to adjust their thinking about the estimates after they form a first impression about it. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The more complex the investigation, the more likely it is that cognitive biases will affect an investigator's decision-making process. </p>

174,<h1>Audiophiles File Suit: Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab Faces Fraud Allegations</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MoFi) is best known by audiophiles and hipsters alike as a record label specializing in the production of reissued vinyl LP records, compact discs and Super Audio CDs that, even in our digital era, remain a popular and sought-after commodity. As anti-fraud professionals know, however, what you see is not always what you get. The same goes for what you hear.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">On July 14, 2022, Mike Esposito, owner of The ‘In’ Groove record store in Phoenix, Ariz., posted a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtJRis-Ba1Q&amp;ab_channel=The%27In%27Groove"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">YouTube video</span></a> that sent the audiophile world spinning. Citing an unknown but “reliable” source, Mike stated that MoFi has been using digital files in its production of so-called original master tape albums despite marketing the reissues as authentic. The fallout of the MoFi revelation threw the audiophile community into something of an existential crisis. The quality of digitized music has long been criticized because of how much data was originally stripped out of files so MP3s could fit on mobile devices. These days, with the right equipment, digital recordings can be so good that they can fool even the best of ears. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Master tapes vs Digital files </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In our world of easy-to-stream music, it may be easy to dismiss the differences between reissues using master tapes and digital files. Master tapes are just that — these are the physical tapes used during the recording process. For bands of the past or artists who are no longer with us, these original recordings become much rarer and more valuable over time. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Earlier this year, MoFi announced a reissue of Michael Jackson’s hit “Thriller,” producing more than 40,000 copies using the original master tapes for the repressing. With so many copies being made and the process requiring the master tapes to be run dozens of times — certainly risking damage to the original tapes — audiophiles were left questioning MoFi’s validity. Why risk damage to tapes that can never be replaced? </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This was neither MoFi’s first, nor last, slip up. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The lawsuit against Mobile Fidelity </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The complaint was brought forward by Adam Stiles, a Charlotte, N.C. resident, who was a frequent customer of MoFi albums for years.  The suit claims that more than 100 titles are involved in the fraud, including some of Mobile Fidelity’s most well-regarded reissues, such as Berlioz’s “Symphonie Fantastique” and The Beatles’ “Revolver.” The lawsuit specifically cites a purchase of The Pretender’s self-titled album that included an “original master recording” designation. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The lawsuit alleges MoFi has been actively misleading customers about its vinyl offerings since at least 2013. On behalf of himself and the proposed class of “all persons in the United States who purchased a Record before July 15, 2022”, Stiles is seeking restitution and damages. The lawsuit also alleges fraud, unjust enrichment, deceptive trade practices, breach of warranty (express and implied) and more.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">After Esposito's video gained traction, MoFi engineers acknowledged the use of digital technology in the process, and Mofi quickly began correcting language on its website and advertising. The suit claims these corrections “demonstrated the breadth of MoFi’s representations and omissions and the material information MoFi misrepresented or failed to disclose.” </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">MoFi’s attorney, Joseph J. Madonia, said in response: “We cannot comment on pending litigation matters at this time.”</p>

175,<h1>The Oversight Role of Supreme Audit Institutions</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Fuimaono Afele, CFE, Ahsiu Lin, CFE, Norris Mitchell, CFE, and Nafanua Tualatamalelagi, CFE, from the Samoa Audit Office.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) play an important role in national and global economy by ensuring that public resources are managed properly and in accordance with established rules. They normally produce an audit opinion, which may give opinions about whether the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the reporting framework. Some SAIs, in addition to performing post-auditing responsibilities, also carry out controller functions of the national treasury--the controller function is a pre-audit function, meaning it is done before the fact. Under the constitutions of some countries, no money can be issued out of the national treasury except in pursuant of a warrant of payment. In addition to this, it is required under the public finance management legislations that, before any such warrant is approved, it should be certified first by the SAI whether the amount thereof may be lawfully issued. Warrants of payments are usually issued based on the appropriations that are approved by the Legislative Assembly, although there are emergency exceptions permitted under the laws of some countries. Even after appropriations are approved by the Legislative Assembly, the finance legislations still require the SAI to pre-audit all payments from the national treasury.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Post-audit functions make up most of the audit functions of SAIs. The first post-audit function focuses on the core government, consisting of ministries and offices of the constitution and parliament, which delivers pure public goods and services.t. In some countries, the core government has a centralized accounting system, so its financial statements are consolidated into a whole of government public accounts. The SAIs in such jurisdictions conduct audits of the individual entities as well as the whole of government financial statements or public accounts. The second post-audit function of SAIs relates to the public enterprises of the government. These entities are usually established as business or commercial units delivering commercial goods and services. The pre-audits and post-audits discussed above are grouped together as the financial audits of the SAIs. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">SAIs in recent years, however, have developed operational audit capacity and capability. Under those operational audit mandates, SAIs usually establish: </p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Performance and environmental audit function or unit. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Compliance audit function or unit. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Information and communication technologies audit function or unit. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A special audit function or unit conducting the audit of fraud, abuse waste and corruption.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">SAIs also provides support services units such as strategic, personnel and corporate services, information and communications technologies, and infrastructure units. Furthermore, SAIs has communications and stakeholder relationships units. While some people consider a communication and relationship unit a support service unit, I think otherwise and consider communication and relationships to be a core function of SAIs. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It is essential for SAIs to communicate the results of their audit work to stakeholders so that it is immediately relevant and helps improve national governance and quality of life. Reporting to parliament has always been the end result of the audit work of SAIs. The preparation and submission of reports by the communications and stakeholder relationships unit to parliament is usually followed by a robust debate, both within and outside parliament, and provides scrutiny on the national governance and financial and performance accountability of those in charge Once the reports are submitted and the parliamentary process is completed, the reports become available on  SAI and parliament websites to keep  stakeholders and any other interested parties informed.  Reports to parliament are only one of the communication channels SAIs use to convey their message, spread news about good and ethical governance, and raise financial and performance accountability required of those in charge of governance. SAIs may also communicate their findings through blogs, newsletters, bulletins, social media etc.   </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Integrity Work in Recent Years</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The integrity work of SAIs can use the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) as guidelines and standards for its planning, fieldwork and reporting. UNCAC, however, does not appear to cover corruption and bribery in the election of members of parliament. I am of the view that UNCAC should address corruption and integrity violations and breaches in all components of the national integrity system, especially the election of members of parliament. Blessings and good fortunes of a country flow from the top, starting with its leaders and down to its citizens. Auditors believe that the tone at the top of an organization sets the direction of what follows below. Therefore, it is important for UNCAC and all national and international integrity initiatives to consider elections as the most important pillar to focus on within the national integrity system.  The SAIs provide oversight in various ways, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Through the controller function over the national treasury. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As the constitutional auditor of the state or public sector, inclusive of the legislature, executive and judiciary. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As the constitutional auditor for the people, citizens and taxpayers. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As an independent advisor to the executive government on its national governance, financial and performance accountability. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As an advocate for good and ethical governance, accountability, transparency and integrity through its communications, education and awareness activities. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As a reporter for the people, citizens and taxpayers who are directly affected by the national governance, as well as the financial and performance accountability of the public sector.</li>

<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;""><strong>Mason</strong>: Can you talk a little bit about what are the best ways for fraud examiners that might not necessarily have as much of a technical background, but are curious to do threat intel?</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;""><strong>Roderick</strong>: Absolutely. Fraud examiners, when they're curious, just the first step, they're curious about cyber security, about IT. I like to encourage those rotational assignment, having a fraud examiner go to the IT department and just dedicate to work with them two to three weeks, learn IT, have them show them the ropes. Likewise, IT gets to go to fraud examiners as well too. Those that have the aptitude, have a desire, the curiosity, go to that unit and work two to three weeks. The cross-pollination of those work, those business units, will really help develop both sides on for fraud examiners and cyber security.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">A lot of times it's do-it-yourself videos. You've seen it before, YouTube, your Google searches, and so forth. You learn a lot just by the instructions that are out there. It's funny when I tell people before, though threat actors aren't geniuses that come up with this on their own, sometimes there's basic tutorials and instructions on the internet. You can just Google search and find out how to do it, but it always starts when I tell the team that I work with and examiners, it's initiating the curiosity. If you're curious about the craft, I'm going to support that and I want to definitely grow that seed of curiosity. I think a lot of both private and public sector has to do is, begin to find those that are curious and then feeding that curiosity. You really can drive up the workforce and that knowledge pool as well.</p>

177,<h1>Shakira Tax Evasion Case: Did the Hips Don't Lie Singer Lie About Where She Was Living?</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Stefanie Hallgren,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">International pop star Shakira has been in the spotlight this past week – not because of a new album or performance, but for a looming trial in a tax fraud case. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">According to the Associated Press, the case involves the Spanish government and taxes owed from the years between 2012 and 2014. Prosecutors allege that Shakira, whose full name is Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, lived in Spain for more than half of each year in 2012, 2013 and 2014, and did not pay the 14.5 million euros in taxes required to live in the country. The Colombian singer is facing six charges and a fine of 24 million euros, which is equivalent to about $24 million. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Spanish prosecutors are claiming Shakira was in Spain most of the years in question, but Shakira’s team says her official residence was in the Bahamas. Prosecutors believe she was living with her then-partner and father of her child, Spanish soccer-star Gerard Piqué, in Spain – not in the Bahamas, where tax rates are lower. The singer was said to have officially moved to Spain in 2015 when she had a second child with Piqué. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Last week, Shakira was offered a deal to settle the case, but the singer did not accept. The case will now go to trial, and prosecutors are seeking a sentence of eight years and two months in prison. So far, a trial date has not been set. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">The back and forth of Shakira’s tax fraud case has been going on since December 2018 when the Spanish government first charged her with tax evasion. At that time, Shakira’s team issued a statement saying that the Spanish government was <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/4ed707fb645644799f997f8f022c5a72"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://apnews.com/article/4ed707fb645644799f997f8f022c5a72"">using her “as a scapegoat”</a> to get other taxpaying delinquents to confess their crimes. Six months later, Shakira testified in court and denied the allegations; however, a judge determined that there was enough evidence to take her to trial. In May of 2022, the singer attempted to appeal the case, but a court dismissed the appeal. </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px;"">Last week, publicists for the singer reported to the Associated Press that Shakira <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-sports-soccer-music-5038d7fbe5db2b54404303acabe7bee1"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-sports-soccer-music-5038d7fbe5db2b54404303acabe7bee1"">“has always cooperated and abided by the law, demonstrating impeccable conduct as an individual and a taxpayer.”</a> </p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has brought insider trading charges against Ishan Wahi, a former Coinbase product manager, his brother Nikhil Wahi and friend Sameer Ramani after they allegedly made profits of more than $1 million by buying crypto assets before their listings on the exchange. According to the DOJ, Ishan leaked confidential information regarding assets to be listed on Coinbase as well as the time of the listing’s public announcement to Nikhil and Ramani on at least 14 occasions between June 2021 and April 2022. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In a separate but related case, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it also brought charges against Coinbase and its co-founders for allegedly making false statements to the agency during its investigation. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">According to the Department of Justice, Ishan Agarwal and Ramani Navin purchased assets shortly before the Coinbase listing announcements using anonymous Ethereum wallets and centralized exchange accounts held in the name of others. The DOJ says the duo earned approximately $1.5 million through such trades involving at least 25 different assets. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-127"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">SEC alleges</span></a> the defendants’ insider trading scheme violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)), which prohibits fraudulent conduct in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, and Rule 10b-5 (17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5), which prohibits materially deceptive or fraudulent conduct in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The SEC has charged Nikhil Wahi and Sameer Ramani with using inside information to trade in crypto assets ahead of more than 10 cryptocurrency-related announcements, including nine that were securities under U.S. law and 16 that were not. The SEC has not explained why 16 of these did not constitute securities under U.S. law. This leaves open the possibility that they were <a href=""https://www.gibsondunn.com/sec-files-first-insider-trading-action-alleging-crypto-assets-are-securities/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">regulated by foreign jurisdictions</span></a> where some crypto assets may be considered legal tender or utility tokens exempt from securities regulations under local laws governing their use cases within those territories. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York filed criminal charges against the Wahi brother and Sameer Ramani for the same conduct it did not allege was securities fraud. The Southern District indictment contains four wire fraud counts in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343: (1) conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Wahi and his brother; (2) a separate conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Wahi and his friend; (3) a substantive count of wire fraud against Wahi and his brother; and (4) a substantive count of wire fraud against Wahi and his friend. </p>

Years later, he and Garth Leonard, CFE, from Valid8 Financial, join ACFE Community Manager Rihonna Scoggins in the most recent episode of Fraud Talk to explore the current resources at hand to combat fraud and how fraud examiners can assess what tools are the right fit for them in this evolving landscape.</em></p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Rihonna</strong>: We're seeing less and less limitations to what we can do as long as we're willing to take advantage of the tools at hand. For CFEs who are looking to advance their toolset, what are some tools that you would recommend, or even tips for how to identify the right tools for them?</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Tod</strong>: I'd really advise taking a look out there at products, Valid8. There's other tools that have been around for a longer period of time just in terms of understanding what is currently available and doing that underwriting and evaluation before you have that big case with the huge deadline. Now's the time to be adding those additional arrows in your quiver, whether that's starting to think about recruiting, training, getting your team up to speed given this is a counter-cyclical industry, and that it's a boomer bust cycle oftentimes, and this labor market's incredibly difficult. We're looking at unemployment rates. I just looked it up, 3.6% right now as of June 2022. Being able to recruit and train and retain those teams are very difficult and labor is not cheap out there. Beginning to start thinking about the team members that you'd want on your team as you grow, and then looking at maximizing the value of that team that you do have by using tools and technologies for the lower level as we've been talking about data extraction and verification and validation.<br/>
Really upskilling your team to challenging and stimulating roles and responsibility versus just grinding through a tremendous amount of data and the QA thereof. From a pricing standpoint, as you're evaluating tools, you're going to need to think about something that ultimately fits you and your clients' business needs that need to align the cost of your tools with the reality of your company's cash flow and client needs. There's a whole variety of models that are out there that we've all seen for different software packages, whether that's a traditional per seat per year to a variable on-demand cost to more traditional annual enterprise licenses with X number of users or perhaps unlimited users.<br/>
In large part, due to the cloud and SaaS, software as a service, sophisticated tools that either didn't exist or perhaps only existed at very large firms given the cost and complexity, either built in-house or sourced with a very expensive license. Those tools are increasingly now available to all fraud and forensic teams, including whether we're talking about a boutique firm with several dozen professionals down even to single-owner professional shops. Price and cost structure is always one of those things that you'll need to take into consideration to make sure that there's alignment thereof.</p>

180,<h1>Fraud Talk: The Oxfraud - What a Pseudo-Academic Conspiracy Theory Tells Us About Financial Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p><em>William Shakespeare is widely considered to be one of the most prolific and influential writers of all time. But one group of individuals, who call themselves “Oxfordians” and their theory the ""Shakespeare Authorship Question,"" falsely claim that what we know to be Shakespeare's plays and poetry were actually penned by someone else. In this episode, ACFE Chief Training Officer John Gill, J.D., CFE, joins Michael Pocalyko, CFE, the CEO of SI, as they look at how the qualities of those claiming to disprove Shakespeare's authorship parallel the character of financial and investment fraudsters.<br/>
<br/>
In the excerpt below from <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/sitecore/content/global/articles/podcasts/2022/may-2022-oxfraud"">episode 120</a>, Michael talks about confirmation bias and how it can be shown through the “Oxfordians”. Download the full transcript in PDF form or listen to the episode at the bottom of this post.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>John</strong>: I think that also plays into one of your points that I maybe taking out of order, and that is confirmation bias. If I want to believe what you're saying, I could look at this like, ""Michael is recommending investment. He has an MBA from Wharton. He knows what he's talking about. I'm all in."" If you're doing proper unbiased due diligence, it's like, ""Yes, that's a well-respected institution, well-respected degree, but does he have any experience in this particular field?""<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Michael</strong>: Sure. It's like if your child needs brain surgery, the guy is an MD, obviously he'll be able to do a simple trephination and subdural hematoma. No, he's not, he's not qualified for that. He is an MD, and so is the brain surgeon, but they-- It's easy to illustrate with medicine. Confirmation bias works importantly here. Our colleague, Bret Hood, recently did a piece for a ACFE about another piece that is related to confirmation bias, which is illusory superiority. In illusory superiority, confirmation bias is what the Oxfraudians do. They drive you down one path, and everything on that path only points to one possible conclusion, and that is that de Vere wrote these plays.<br/>
<br/>
It is heavy-duty confirmation bias along with illusory superiority. Like confirmation bias, and again, this is Bret Hood's theory and proof, illusory superiority is where you overestimate your own abilities. That's key to all of these Oxfraudians. When you read their stuff, it's the most pedantic garbage writing. They don't know how to construct a simple sentence. Maybe that's the legacy of Edward de Vere, who was also an awful writer. The heavy-duty confirmation bias is what says, ""Listen to me, just believe me. Your eyes will be opened.""<br/>
<br/>
In their formulation, any regulated authority is scorned, because in their world, regulated authority is self-interested. By that I mean, ""Those Stratfordians,"" which is the derisive term that the Oxfraudians use for real Shakespeareans, ""They only have their own club, and you people at the Red Roof Inn get ready to invest with me. You've been left out of all of these clubs. We're going to start our own club."" In this case, the people in the club only listen to themselves. If you actually look at some of their so-called academic writing, it is not double-blind reviewed.<br/>
<br/>
It is not subject to peer review by credentialed real university persons. Yes, some of them have actual university appointments, but when they publish they are self-publishing. It is no small coincidence that the rise of self-publishing and the diminishment of cost of self-publishing has resulted in an explosion of these kinds of books. They also constantly, and this is again what financial fraudsters will do, they will selectively apply partial truth. They will use unverified assertion that certainly sounds true to construct a false narrative that also includes partial verified third-party verifiable fact.</p>

181,"<h1>Mentoring Success Story: Kate Rolan and David Harper, CFE</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/community/acfe-mentoring-program"">ACFE Mentoring Program</a> connects members to anti-fraud professionals from all over the world who can offer a wealth of resources, experience, advice and guidance. Mentees can search among registered mentors to find individuals whose experience and expertise match the areas in which they wish to be mentored. Kate Rolan initially reached out to David Harper, CFE, after seeing his experience in law enforcement and investigations on the <a href=""http://connect.acfe.com"">ACFE Community</a>. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This is Kate and David’s mentoring story.   </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become interested in fraud and what is your current role? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Kate</strong>: I am currently employed as an Internal Revenue Agent for Tax Exempt and Government Entities, IRS. I got interested in fraud about three years ago when I started working on a case showing some fraud indicators. The audit was complicated but very interesting. I decided to learn more about fraud, talked to my colleagues, found out about ACFE, and joined!  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>David</strong>: I became interested in fighting against fraud early in my federal law enforcement career when I was assigned to the New York City office of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. I had previously worked in general crimes, including homicides, sexual assaults and property crimes. I had an opportunity to become involved in complex financial crimes and fraud against the government. I found these types of cases were more challenging and captured my attention. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">After retiring from federal law enforcement in 2016, I successfully sought an opportunity as the Inspector General for the City of Albuquerque, where I worked for a few years before accepting an opportunity as the Inspector General for the Florida Department of Financial Services. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Why was it important for both of you to join the Mentoring Program? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Kate</strong>: I was looking for a mentor who was experienced in fraud investigation and could provide guidance for real-life tough audits and give some tips for case development. I wanted to learn more about the ACFE and expand my network contacts. Another goal was to prepare for the CFE exam and get advice from a person who had already done it. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>David</strong>: I’ve had many informal mentors during my career from whom I gained so much knowledge.  I have long believed it was important to give back by sharing my knowledge and experience with others. It is a great way to pay it forward. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Kate, what inspired you to request David? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Kate</strong>: I thought that it was a great opportunity to learn from a professional. I was looking for real-life experience, willingness to teach, and a positive attitude. David is very compassionate about mentoring and went out of his way to help me to grow professionally in a new field for me. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">David, how did you know Kate would be the right mentee for your experience and skillset? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>David</strong>: After receiving a request from Kate to be her mentor, we had an opportunity to talk and spoke about what she was seeking. Since my background is in law enforcement and investigations, rather than accounting and auditing, I wanted to be sure that I was the right person to help her. I told her that I could help in the investigations area, and it turned out that was what she was seeking. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What advice do you both have for anyone who wants to join the ACFE Mentoring Program?  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Kate</strong>: I know it's not always easy to find a mentor. I would recommend starting to search for potential mentors earlier, before the program officially starts and send requests to several mentors. Then have a discovery call with all potential mentors who responded to your requests. During your conversation ask questions, explain your expectations for the mentoring program and listen to your interlocutor, thus you will be able to find a mentor who best meets your expectations. You will have a very rewarding learning experience, meet a new colleague and expand your expertise. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>David</strong>: I believe the ACFE Mentoring program provides great potential for learning and networking. It’s not just the mentee learning from the mentor, but an exchange of experiences, ideas and advice—a win-win opportunity! </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What challenges did you face during your session? How did you handle adversity to still have a productive mentoring session? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>David</strong>: Unfortunately, I was diagnosed with severe COVID and was hospitalized followed by 24-hour oxygen treatment for a few months after my hospitalization. Because I wasn’t able to actively mentor Kate during this time, I told her that I would continue to mentor her for a few more months afterwards. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Kate</strong>: I don't think we had many challenges. David had created a plan for our sessions and every meeting we discussed a new topic, I asked questions. During our collaboration with David, I have learned a lot of new information about fraud investigation process and other issues. He was always on time and followed his promises to provide the materials or cover new interesting topics. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What has been the most rewarding part of your journey together?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Kate</strong>: I am very grateful to David for his very warm, friendly attitude and his desire to teach and share his knowledge of fraud examination with a newbie. David was my first ACFE mentor and after having such a positive experience with him, I decided to continue participating in the ACFE Mentoring program. I understood the fraud investigation process as a whole and realized I want to continue to learn and become a fraud investigator myself. I definitely feel more prepared for the exam and I'm going to study harder and take it this year. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>David</strong>: I believe our mentoring relationship provided both of us with an opportunity to learn about new things that will help each of us in our fight against fraud. For me, Kate’s experience as a revenue agent for the Internal Revenue Service, allowed me to learn more about the mission of IRS and how they detect and investigate tax fraud. </p>

182,<h1>Former Theranos COO Found Guilty on Federal Fraud Charges</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Emma Richardson </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">On Thursday, a jury of seven women and five men <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/tech/sunny-balwani-verdict-theranos/index.html"">convicted</a> Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani on 12 counts of federal fraud. Balwani, the former COO of <a href=""https://www.acfeinsights.com/acfe-insights/2021/11/17/fraud-talk-understanding-the-art-and-science-of-the-theranos-saga"">Theranos</a>, reportedly sat expressionless as the verdicts were read in court. Some of the charges Balwani was found guilty of included federal wire fraud and conspiracy to commit federal wire fraud.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The conclusion to Balwani’s trial marks a noticeably different outcome from that of his former Theranos counterpart and one-time lover Elizabeth Holmes, who herself was <a href=""https://www.acfeinsights.com/acfe-insights/2022/1/5/elizabeth-holmes-found-guilty-on-four-charges-of-fraud"">found guilty</a> on just four fraud charges in a separate trial earlier this year. Unlike Holmes, Balwani was convicted on all the counts he was charged with; Holmes, conversely, was convicted on just four counts of wire fraud, but acquitted on four counts of defrauding patients. The jury in Holmes’s trial was also unable to reach a verdict on three of the seven charges related to defrauding investors that were rendered against her. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Balwani, 57, faces up to 20 years in prison, as well as a $250,000 fine plus restitution for each count of fraud. His sentencing is expected to take place in November, with Holmes’s set for September. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The convictions of both Holmes and Balwani make for a rare victory in the fight against fraud among Silicon Valley start-ups. Though the Theranos case is exceptionally high-profile and well-known, the splintered convictions in the Holmes trial show how difficult it can be to convince a jury of a defendant’s fraudulent intent. Even Balwani’s case was deliberated by jurors for four days before a verdict was reached. It’s worth noting that Balwani’s personal likeability, or lack thereof, might have played a role in landing him a stronger slew of convictions than Holmes, given that she testified in her own trial that Balwani verbally and sexually abused her during their relationship; allegations that his lawyer has denied. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In a statement submitted to CNN Business, Balwani’s attorney Jeffrey Coopersmith advised that he and his team plan to explore options for appeal. </p>

183,<h1>Take Pride in Fighting Fraud: How the LGBTQ Community Can Stay Vigilant All Year Long</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Emma Richardson </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>Pride Month may be over, but, for scammers, the calendar doesn’t matter: there’s fraud to be had every month of the year. It’s more important than ever for the LGBTQ+ community to maintain its collective strength – especially when it comes to the scams that target them. Here are some of the most common fraud schemes perpetrated against members of the LGBTQ+ community, along with some useful tips on how to identify, deter and successfully circumvent these fraud attempts.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Romance Fraud</h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">As the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) points out in its <a href=""https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2022/06/celebrate-pride-fight-fraud"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2022/06/celebrate-pride-fight-fraud"">post</a> about fraud during Pride Month, many of the tools and resources cultivated by the LGBTQ+ community can be easily weaponized by fraudsters. It’s a very dirty trick, given that many in the community report struggling with isolation and loneliness, and therefore rely on outlets like dating and neighborhood apps to feel more connected to those around them. While the FTC states romance scams cost victims an <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2021/02/romance-scams-take-record-dollars-2020"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2021/02/romance-scams-take-record-dollars-2020"">estimated $304 million in 2020</a>, it may be impossible to know exactly what percentage of those victims were LGBTQ+ members, as the FTC does not delineate fraud victims by sexual orientation or gender identity. One aspect of romance fraud in the LGBTQ+ community that differentiates it from romance fraud committed against heterosexual targets is that these scams are more likely be extortive in nature than emotionally manipulative or compelling. Romance fraudsters preying upon LGBTQ+ victims frequently convince their intended targets to send compromising photos or messages, then threaten to release these items publicly or send them to friends and family of the victim unless the victim pays them. Compare this to romance scams where the fraudster implores the victim with some kind of “sob story”. For example, a medical or financial emergency has arisen and fast cash is needed. Of course, these types of manipulative scams can also target LGBTQ+ members. However, extortion scams stick out as an especially low form of fraud amongst victims who have historically been forced to keep their identities closeted.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">To avoid being the victim of a romance scam, the FTC recommends never sending money to anyone that you have not met in person. It’s also a good idea to do a <a href=""https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid"">reverse Google image search</a> on the profile picture of any individuals you connect with on an app. You may be surprised what you find. If someone is actively extorting you, or has in the past, you can report itto the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative by calling the crisis hotline at 844-878-CCRI (2274).</p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Affinity Fraud</h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">LGBTQ+ people are also at risk for affinity fraud schemes, as these frauds target the demographic members of a specific identity or community. To win over trust from victims, fraudsters often pose as members of the demographic in question and, after building relationships, can rope victims into Ponzi schemes or other common investment scams. Perhaps the most well-known example of an affinity fraud scheme targeting the LGBTQ+ community occurred in 2012, when the Securities and Exchange Commission <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/billsinger/2012/11/09/feds-charge-affinity-ponzi-fraud-hit-gay-community/?sh=6da5d3e5339d"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/billsinger/2012/11/09/feds-charge-affinity-ponzi-fraud-hit-gay-community/?sh=6da5d3e5339d"">filed a complaint</a> in southern Florida against a 67-year-old man who was accused of defrauding investors out of as much as $11 million – many of whom were well-known members of the local gay community.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Potential victims of affinity frauds can keep themselves protected by taking extra precautions around proposed investment opportunities. The SEC <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/ia_affinityfraud.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.sec.gov/files/ia_affinityfraud.pdf"">recommends</a> researching the background of any individual soliciting an investment – as well as <em>never</em> making an investment based exclusively on the endorsement of a community or organization member to which the potential victim may belong.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Charity Fraud</h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">In our high-octane political atmosphere, solicitations for charitable donations are more ubiquitous than ever. Therefore, it’s incumbent upon well-meaning donors to be on the lookout for suspicious contribution requests or charities that don’t seem quite on the up-and-up. While <a href=""https://lgbtfunders.org/newsposts/alert-phishing-scam-financial-information-lgbtqi-nonprofits-ngos/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://lgbtfunders.org/newsposts/alert-phishing-scam-financial-information-lgbtqi-nonprofits-ngos/"">alerts sent out</a> by legitimate organizations can help shed light onto scams already in progress, members of the LGBTQ+ community must still remain as wary as anyone of email or text solicitations for money or personal data.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">As always, the FTC recommends <a href=""https://consumer.ftc.gov/features/how-donate-wisely-and-avoid-charity-scams"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://consumer.ftc.gov/features/how-donate-wisely-and-avoid-charity-scams"">doing your research</a> before hitting the “donate” button. If you receive an email or text message from an organization make sure to first look them up independently and confirm the organization’s legitimacy. Specifically, a best practice for researching charitable organizations is to type the name of the organization into Google and add the words “scam” or “complaint” to your search. Another potential red flag is when organizations ask for donations to be sent as cryptocurrency. While a cryptocurrency transaction is not itself an indicator of fraud, contributors may want to think twice before initiating one to an unverified organization. Organizations that solicit payment in any currency with potentially untraceable origins (cash, a prepaid gift card, wiring money, etc.) should be looked at twice.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Elder Fraud</h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">With the population of LGBTQ+ members who are aged 50 or older expected to increase to 5 million individuals by 2030, it’s perhaps no surprise that this demographic is <a href=""https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2022/lgbtq-adults-vulnerable-to-fraud.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2022/lgbtq-adults-vulnerable-to-fraud.html"">especially vulnerable</a> to scams targeting senior citizens. What’s more, older LGBTQ+ community members are statistically more likely to be estranged from their biological families and less likely than their heterosexual peers to have children; thus, rendering them prime targets for scams that prey upon the elderly or people living on fixed incomes.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px;"">To help fight back, the organization <a href=""https://www.sageusa.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.sageusa.org/"">SAGE</a>, which provides advocacy and resources for aging LGBTQ+ community members, has developed an app called “<a href=""https://www.sageusa.org/what-we-do/sagecents/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.sageusa.org/what-we-do/sagecents/"">SageCents</a>.” The app assists its users with increasing financial literary and personalized financial health to help them avoid becoming open to the types of scams that are easily pinpointed on the vulnerable and desperate. It also exposes users to information on recent fraud schemes and empowers them with reporting tools and support outlets, in case they’ve already been victimized.</p>

184,<h1>Support Groups for Fraud Victims</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Ryan Gregory, CFE</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As investigators, we have all reached the point in the span of our interviews of what can be said or suggested next in support of fraud victims. With all the busy work of report writing, speaking to law enforcement, preparing for court and filing examination findings, we do not always remember the trauma a financial loss can be to the victim.  As trained as we are, we may not have experienced fraud in our own lives to understand the emotional impact it can have. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To say fraud is pervasive would be an understatement. According to the <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/02/reports-romance-scams-hit-record-highs-2021"">Federal Trade Commission</a>, in 2021, losses related to romance scams were valued at $547 million dollars, more than six times the reported losses in 2017. The <a href=""https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220504"">FBI reports</a> that business email compromise (BEC) saw a 65% increase of both actual and attempted loss between July 2019 and December 2021 as fraudsters continued to target both large and small businesses through compromised email accounts. The <a href=""https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3ElderFraudReport.pdf"">FBI’s 2021 Elder Fraud Report</a> states, “the number of elderly victims has risen at an alarming rate,” and victims over the age of 60 reported losses of $1.7 billion. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There is a victim behind each of these numbers: some were able to recover funds, others may have seen arrests and then there are the unfortunate victims who lost it all. An article worth re-reading is the ACFE’s January/February 2019 <em>Fraud Magazine</em> entitled, “Who’s More Susceptible to Fraud?” by Donn LeVie Jr., CFE. It covers the psychology of the fraud attack and the psychological damage a victim may feel. LeVie offers the following statement towards the end of the article: “Victims often carry scars that transcend the loss of funds. Fraudsters can permanently bruise vulnerable souls with their deception and deceit.” </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Romance fraud victim Jeanne Aikens shares her story in the <a href=""https://www.nhbr.com/romance-scams-bedevil-law-enforcement-in-new-hampshire-elsewhere/"">New Hampshire Business Review</a>. It’s a story of money gone, a scammer that wasn’t caught and the shame felt in being misled. This article also discusses the misconceptions surrounding romance fraud, how it is targeting all age groups and how difficult prosecution is. In the end, Jeanne tells us she has found love and gotten married but still carries emotional bruises from this ordeal. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As an investigator who speaks to victims on a weekly basis, I wanted to bring attention to the following groups in the hope that victims can get help or support. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><a href=""https://fightcybercrime.org/peer-support/"">Fight Cybercrime</a></h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This site offers a peer support program for victims of romance scams. Those who are interested can sign up or refer someone for a 10-week virtual program that includes a counselor. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><a href=""https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/voa-rest-program/"">AARP Fraud Watch Network VOA | ReST Program</a></h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">AARP Fraud Watch Network and Volunteer of America (VOA) have created a program that offers scam/fraud victims emotional support that includes peer discussion groups. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><a href=""https://victimsofcrime.org/financial-crime-resource-center/?sfw=pass1653871635"">National Identity Theft Victim Assistance Network</a></h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A network of coalitions across the country that deliver identity theft and cyber-crime victim assistance training. Training is provided to coalition members on how to provide direct victim assistance services. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As my wife <a href=""https://climb.pcc.edu/blog/meet-your-instructor-neera-malhotra"">Dr. Neera Malhotra</a> (Professor with Portland State University) reminds me, the accompaniment of others helps in understanding, accepting and releasing trauma. </p>

185,<h1>Zelle Scams Are on The Rise: A Look at a Recent Attempt</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Kate Pospisil,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It is common these days to sell items we no longer need on online marketplaces such as Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace. It’s easy, local and usually fast. The process is further simplified through the use of peer-to-peer (P2P) payment methods such as Venmo, PayPal and Zelle. However, this ease to buy and sell can attract fraudsters looking to make a quick buck. I personally use Facebook Marketplace frequently and when I recently sold my treadmill, I experienced a scam attempt firsthand.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">First-hand look at the red flags</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Now, I am no stranger to scam attempts, and I design my posts to prevent this as much as I can: I clarify Venmo or cash only (with a Venmo hold), I only provide my address after the payment or hold is sent, I don’t generally share my phone number etc. I listed my treadmill on Facebook Marketplace and within one minute, I had a message regarding the post; it was through Facebook Messenger, but from an Instagram account. This man wanted to pay in full immediately and pick up the next day, but he wanted to pay with Zelle. I refused and said Venmo only, but I eventually relaxed a bit figuring it was not much different — in some ways it might even better since money sent via Zelle goes directly into a bank account, whereas Venmo and PayPal go into their own accounts. After all, he was sending the full amount with no questions or counteroffers. I gave him the number attached to my Zelle account; however, he then requested my email address, saying it’s easier to find the account that way. I’m not terribly familiar with Zelle, so I gave him my email address and told him I’d need a minute to make sure it’s attached to the account. Before even confirming the email with Zelle, I received an email… from Zelle. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><img alt=""zelle scam 1"" src=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/images/acfe/blog/zelle-scam-blog-2022-1.jpg?h=201.222&amp;w=885.222&amp;hash=51BCD6CDA415E2EBDE9E6B4C34C50FA3"" style=""height: 313.222px; width: 1083.89px;""/></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">At this point, I realized this was a scam attempt and all the prior red flags were much more obvious. I told the fraudster that it felt suspicious and that I would be calling my bank. He hurried to assure me that “this happens to him all the time,” it’s “because [I] don’t have a business account.” He said repeatedly that he would just transfer me the additional $400, then I could send it back and the hold would release on the original transfer. However, Zelle allows personal accounts to send and receive up to $2,000 a day, so that clearly was not the issue here, meaning I would end up transferring $400 and receiving nothing. I thanked him for giving me the basis for my next fraud blog and blocked him, then rushed to check my bank account and make sure it was unscathed. After confirming all was well on my end, I <a href=""https://www.zellepay.com/support/report-scam#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20enrolled%20in,form%20to%20report%20the%20scam."" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.zellepay.com/support/report-scam#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20enrolled%20in,form%20to%20report%20the%20scam."">reported him</a> and began mentally outlining this blog.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">This fake/false payment scam is only one of the frauds perpetuated through Zelle. In fact, Zelle is being <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/business/zelle-fraud.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/business/zelle-fraud.html"">questioned</a> by senators regarding how it responds to its many cases of fraud. Even though Zelle is owned and operated by banks, banks are claiming no responsibility when it comes to fraud committed using their app.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Another <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/business/payments-fraud-zelle-banks.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/business/payments-fraud-zelle-banks.html"">common scam</a> is when a fraudster pretends to be the bank and contacts the victim to alert them about a fraudulent transaction. The fraudster then scams the victim by encouraging them to “return” the money to themselves using Zelle, but the fraudster has already intercepted their bank account. Because the victim is initiating and approving the fraudulent transfer, the bank declares it not fraudulent, leaving the victim out of money and options. Many victims of this scheme have only been reimbursed after going to the media with their stories.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Protecting yourself as a user          </h2>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Online payments through apps such as Zelle are easy to use and serve a valid purpose in today’s digital society. However, as easy as they are to use, they also give fraudsters an easily accessible path to steal your money. The following are some basic tips to help keep you safe, but always remember to remain vigilant.</p>
<ol>
<li style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Never transfer money to someone you would not hand a $100 bill to — once you send the money, it is gone, and there is very little you can do to get it back in the case of fraud.</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Know the requirements and stipulations for the system through which you are transferring funds.</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Be suspicious about text messages from your bank — do not click links, open attachments or enter personal account information.</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">If you receive a phone call from your bank regarding an online transaction or P2P payment, end it and call the number on the back of your bank card.</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">Report any scam attempts to Zelle.</li>

186,<h1>How To Catch a Fraudster That Doesn’t Exist</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Neil Dubord, CFE, Chief of Delta Police Department</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">With the development of websites such as <a href=""https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en"">This Person Does Not Exist</a>, anti-fraud professionals are continuing to see a rise in synthetic identity fraud. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><a href=""https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/news/press-releases/federal-reserve-system-white-paper-examines-mitigation-of-synthetic-identity-payments-fraud/"">Synthetic identity fraud</a> occurs when perpetrators combine piecemeal and, at times, factual information to create a new identity. These identities are cheap, quick and easy to produce, and may include a factual piece, or pieces, of information from sources such as breached data sites. Synthetic identity fraud is reportedly the fastest-growing type of financial crime, costing online lenders <a href=""https://www.pymnts.com/identity-theft/2022/synthetic-identity-fraud-costs-businesses-billions-each-year-data-shows/"">more than $6 billion annually</a>. With the explosive growth of decentralized finance, synthetic identity fraud will continue to rise. Besides its insidious nature, synthetic identity fraud is also becoming one of the most challenging frauds to detect, investigate and prosecute.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraudsters may take years to build good credit with their synthetic identity through a series of small purchases or loans that they pay off quickly. All this time, they are working to build trust and creditability with lenders so they can take out a large withdrawal — or in other words, one big payday. Once they have successfully defrauded their victim and obtained the asset they were pursuing, the fraudster will abandon the synthetic identity and never use it again. Abandoning the identity is called <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-score/what-is-synthetic-fraud/"">""busting out.”</a> Investigations are further complicated because the information is fragmented, and often identifying pieces of information, such as social insurance numbers, belong to real people. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">With the growth of decentralized finance and online lending processes, a proactive, multilayered approach is recommended for Know Your Customer (KYC) assessments. To put a spin on a time-honored phrase, the best offense is a good defense, and that defense for synthetic identity fraud is KYC.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In today's era, determining if a thief uses a synthetic identity can involve implementing advanced technology. The implementation of technology such as artificial intelligence and blockchain will serve to assist in <a href=""https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/articles/synthetic-identity-fraud"">preventing individuals from building and using synthetic identities</a>. Many believe that blockchain technology used in some areas of decentralized finance allows individuals to remain anonymous and to commit their criminal acts undetected. However, this is not true, and companies such as <a href=""https://www.chainalysis.com/"">Chainalysis</a> have developed a platform that powers investigations, compliance and risk management, and ultimately helps solve crimes. Not all organizations have the sophistication or resources to implement technology to assist with synthetic identity fraud detection, which begs the question of what organizations can do right now to defend against this type of fraud. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A thorough KYC process is still an effective and efficient tool for recognizing synthetic identities. If a thief is going to go through the effort of creating a synthetic identity, they typically do not provide a picture of themselves. A vigilant compliance officer undertaking a methodical KYC process should use as many tools as possible to validate that the information received, including the person's picture, is accurate. Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is a tool that is often used to provide additional information.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A new free tool to add to your KYC toolkit involves a free, easy-to-use Chrome extension, <a href=""https://petapixel.com/?s=deepfakes"">PetaPixel</a>, which can be used to detect fake pictures like those produced by This Person Does Not Exist. This new tool claims to distinguish fake pictures with <a href=""https://petapixel.com/2022/03/18/chrome-extension-can-detect-fake-profile-pictures-with-99-29-accuracy/"">99.29% accuracy</a>. It is quick and straightforward to use. First, you install the PetaPixel Chrome extension. Once it has been installed, photos can be scanned in seconds and the results can then be used as part of your KYC process. It is important to note that currently PetaPixel extension only works on GaN-generated images, such as those images from This Person Does Not Exist. Although I recommend using PetaPixel, it should not be the sole source of information in your KYC assessment, as high-quality deepfakes will not be detected.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">KYC assessments are an iterative process, and compliance officers should always be looking for new ways to protect their organizations against fraud. While tools like PetaPixel are not a silver bullet, fraud examiners should explore such offerings to aid in the assessment process. </p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Grab the popcorn, uncork the wine and settle in for a wild ride. Fraudsters and their schemes are having quite a moment in pop culture. We have compiled a list of the most popular recent limited series, documentaries and films about fraud that can add context to known cases, illustrate some common fraud schemes and provide insight into the fraudsters at the center of these now infamous frauds. Keep in mind, some of these shows may have taken a few liberties with the details of the cases for entertainment purposes.</p>

188,"<h1>The Golden Era of Fraud Investigations Is Upon Us, But It Relies on Better Financial eDiscovery</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>By: Tod McDonald, CPA and Garth Leonard, CFE<br/>
<br/>
Recent reports show that PPP loan fraud soared in the last two years, putting billions of taxpayer dollars in the pockets of fraudsters and criminals. The Justice Department now faces an unprecedented number of cases to investigate and experts suggest it will be difficult, if not impossible, to build cases and convict all of those responsible. The merits of speeding aid versus having required additional guardrails can be debated endlessly but regardless, one thing stands out about these fraud cases: it’s challenging to “follow the money,” and the burden on teams having to investigate is exceptionally high.<br/>
<br/>
How can we better assess which fraud cases warrant further investigation and find suspect financial relationships and data? How can we improve on what CFEs and partners look at as a dataset? Most importantly — why are we still relegated to manual transcription, legacy optical character recognition (OCR) software and eDiscovery tools, which only evaluate included email systems, mobile devices and file shares, or open-source intelligence from social media sites and forums?<br/>
<br/>
Manual transcription and legacy OCR software shortcomings are evident. eDiscovery solutions, while adept at uncovering key relationships and activities, don’t specifically look at bank or brokerage statements, check images or data direct from financial institutions. This makes fraudulent or suspect financial movements difficult to identify. They don’t truly “follow the money” but rather point to potential financial connections that then require further investigation and valuable staff time. Bank and brokerage statements and monetary transfers, arguably the most significant pieces of information to uncover financial fraud, are simply not included or evaluated in the vast majority of today’s eDiscovery and audit tools.</p>
<p>These lessons were front and center for Tod, as he worked as the lead investigator in <a href=""https://www.seattlemet.com/news-and-city-life/2018/03/darren-berg-has-always-been-on-the-run"">Washington’s largest</a> Ponzi scheme — ultimately unraveling a $150 million complex case with a myriad of actors and financial accounts. Creating financial eDiscovery, not just eDiscovery, is key to not only ensuring accuracy in our investigations but to speeding up the time involved and in identifying where we need to focus versus where we do not. Creating financial datasets — and using today’s more modern technologies to assess and analyze the flow of funds — saves critical staff-time, removes the more menial pieces of an investigation and allows lead investigators and CFEs to use their time judiciously.<br/>
 <br/>
 We will be faced with an unprecedented era and an overwhelming number of fraud cases in the decade ahead. In periods of inexpensive capital and consistent economic expansion, high risk and even fraudulent activities can be masked or even rewarded. But we are starting to see a macroeconomic change; as the money supply becomes more constrained and the cost of capital increases, liquidity and the ability to access funds will become restricted. In other words, the tide is going out and we’ll all get to see who is wearing a swimsuit and who isn’t.<br/>
<br/>
This new macro-environment is bound to expose weak business models, high-risk investments, fraud and Ponzi schemes. There is an abundance of financial fraud cases in our future; we see it in the number of PPP loan fraud cases showing up, and we will see it even more as the economy shifts. This represents the opportunity of a lifetime for CFEs.<br/>
<br/>
Those that embrace new concepts, like financial eDiscovery, will thrive, while those relying on manual procedures and legacy OCR software will fall behind.  <br/>
<br/>
The reality is that we are all well-served by bringing more rigor and ease to fraud investigations and fronting them with the tools that truly follow the money. Judging by both the news and the impending restriction of the economic cycle, there is going to be lots of money to follow in the decade ahead.</p>

189,<h1>Fraud Talk: A Look at the Growing Issue of Medical Identity Theft</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>While victims of traditional identity theft often catch it quickly, victims of medical identity theft may not know they are victims until they need critical medical treatment. In this episode, Scott Ward, CFE, senior vice president at Qlarant, discusses the insidious nature of medical identity theft, the impact it has on its victims and what people and governments can do to help combat it.</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>In the excerpt below from <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/podcast/podcast-detail?s=2022-april-medical-ID-theft"">episode 119</a>, Ward talks with Sarah Thompson, ACFE Communications Manager, about how medical identity theft is committed by fraudsters and misconceptions.</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Ward: </strong>Well, with traditional regular identity theft, you most likely are going to realize it relatively quickly that it happens such as credit card, fraud, or theft. You might get an alert from your company that you have your credit card with, or you get an alert from your bank because there's a lot of checks and balances in place. In most cases when it comes to medical identity theft, you really don't know you may have been a victim until maybe you go for medical treatments or you have some life-threatening emergency procedure. It's something that can happen and can sit and grow for years without you ever knowing.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Thompson: </strong>That sounds just like the worst-case scenario if you're going in for something that you're already possibly stressed out because you have to make a serious medical decision and only to find out then when you're at your lowest [chuckles] that someone has stolen that. That's horrible. What is it about healthcare data specifically that makes it an attractive target for fraudsters trying to steal identities? Are there fraudsters that only target medical identity theft, or do they also do a regular identity theft or a mix of the two, but what is it about medical data?</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Ward: </strong>Well, I think that what is a common misconception is that the public may or may not realize the value of what their data is related to medical care, the value of it. From a Medicare/Medicaid standpoint, a person's personal health information or your identifiers are valued anywhere from a million to $1.5 million in potential medical charges that could be billed to those contracts. Then private insurance, it could be even more than that depending upon what type of services that you may see that have been fraudulently billed.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">From a standpoint of the types of frauds out there, fraudsters believe that it's a victimless crime because they're not impacting anyone, but that's really not the case. There are some other reasons why this is something that's really attractive or targeted is because with the compromised credentials, identity thieves can use that victims' data to even acquire medical treatments, receive elective surgeries, get prescriptions filled as well. They can also use that information to sell to other individuals that may not have healthcare benefits or things of that nature that another individual could actually get the benefits instead of who actually those benefits are intended for.</p>

190,"<h1>Member Spotlight: Paul McCormack, CFE</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Paul McCormack, CFE, began his career in anti-fraud as a forensic accountant and after gaining a wealth of experience, he made the leap and started his own <a href=""https://www.mccormackwrites.com/"">freelance writing business in the fraud and compliance space</a>. Paul has written for countless publications and companies throughout the industry, including <a href=""https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4295005150""><em>Fraud Magazine</em></a>.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become passionate about fighting fraud?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">My career as an anti-fraud professional happened by accident. In my first job as a forensic accountant, I traveled a great deal and became interested in the airline industry. When I contacted a headhunter who worked with Delta, the only role she had available was a project manager in charge of fraud investigations. Initially, I turned down the chance to interview for the role as the fraud cases I had worked on as a forensic accountant weren’t that challenging. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Twenty-four hours later, I changed my mind. While the fraud cases I had worked on weren’t as demanding, I’d only been exposed to a handful of cases. It dawned on me that there was much I had to learn, so I took the opportunity. I interviewed and joined Delta as a project manager and was later promoted to the manager of Delta’s Revenue Protection Unit, with responsibility for passenger, agency and employee investigations worldwide.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you make the switch from being in the industry to creating content?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Making the switch to creating content was another accident. While studying for an MBA, I received compliments from professors on written assignments. After graduating, I decided to see if I could freelance on the side and develop my writing skills. I signed up for a freelance writing newsletter and read a help-wanted ad for writers with knowledge of economics, accounting and the law. I applied and started receiving writing assignments immediately. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">For years, I continued to write on the side, picking up new clients through word of mouth. In 2014, I was between companies and decided to take a leap and focus on writing full time. Within weeks I had a steady client base. Today, my business is thriving. I work with clients around the globe to develop fraud, security and compliance-related content. It’s demanding work, yet it is incredibly gratifying to see my work in print — although most of the time I serve as a ghostwriter. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What are some challenges of writing about fraud?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Anyone who fights fraud for a living knows how quickly the landscape changes. Similar to fighting fraud, writing about fraud means I must stay up to date on the latest tools and tactics. For me, that’s the biggest challenge. I’m often asked to immerse myself in a complex topic and then develop content to help others understand the nuances of a new fraud scheme or innovative technology designed to prevent it. That requires reading countless articles, white papers, blog posts and interviewing subject matter experts. With that said, I enjoy a challenge and writing about fraud or any of the areas I cover is rarely dull.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is an important lesson you’ve learned in your career?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Don’t be too quick to judge. This lesson is applicable when evaluating potential career changes, fraud suspects or any other circumstance which involves a degree of uncertainty. If possible, give yourself the gift of time to assess a situation fully. And if you make a mistake, don’t be afraid to admit it and reverse course. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is important to you about being a CFE? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Earning the CFE designation opened my eyes to fraud. The breadth and depth of subjects covered in the CFE exam gave me a solid foundation to build my career as an anti-fraud professional, then launch my writing career many years later. While I’ve lost count of the fraud investigations I’ve conducted and managed, articles I’ve written and presentations I’ve delivered, this is still much I don’t know. Maintaining my certification, reading <em>Fraud Magazine</em> and writing for the ACFE provide constant reminders that fraud is constantly evolving. To stay relevant and serve my clients, I must commit myself to the lifelong learning that the ACFE provides.</p>

191,<h1>Is This Recruiter a Scammer? Red Flags to Look Out for During the Great Resignation</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the past year, <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/01/roughly-47-million-people-quit-their-job-last-year.html"">record numbers</a> of employees have been quitting their jobs, and sometimes leaving entire industries. With so much turmoil in the job market, it comes as no surprise that fraudsters are pouncing. Career scammers <a href=""https://www.howtogeek.com/783231/how-to-spot-fake-jobs-and-recruiters/"">are targeting job seekers</a> using LinkedIn to reach out with fake offers and requesting personal information. The message may look like it’s coming from a legitimate company — but its origin is much more sinister. These scammers are attempting to steal your information and money. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The fraudsters are using the same tactics as other phishing scams, but this time it's disguised as a job offer. The messages may come from fake profiles with few connections or look similar to real company accounts. The job offers sometimes include details about the company that appear legitimate, like saying you were referred by a friend who used to work for the company.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While it may appear that there are a plethora of opportunities around every corner, it’s important to stay vigilant in the hunt for new employment and sort the “good” from the “too good to be true.” Here are some red flags to look out for:</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Bare-bones recruiter profiles</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Review the recruiter’s profile. If you get a message from a recruiter who has few or no friends in common with you, or whose profile picture looks generic and doesn’t have any other images of them (or their face is obscured), this can be a sign that the account is affiliated with a recruiting scam. Also look out for free-use emails like Gmail or Hotmail; while a company domain doesn’t ensure the user is not a scammer, it is easier to verify.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Sensitive information before the interview or offer</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Scammers may try to solicit your personal information by asking you to fill out a credit report on a suspicious website or set up a bank account for the purpose of stealing your identity. If the recruiter asks you to share sensitive information like your address, bank account details, tax ID number or social security number, be wary. Typically, only contact information, resume, references and salary expectations should be necessary early on in the process.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Funds trading hands</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The goal of any job is to receive payment for your work, not to pay to work. Do not trust a company or recruiter that asks you to send money to secure a job — once payment is received the account will be deactivated and your money will be lost. Similarly, reputable companies will not ask you to transfer or receive funds on behalf of someone else. This is an immediate red flag that the job in question is a scam.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To avoid falling victim to this type of scam, be cautious if you receive a job offer over LinkedIn and other recruiting platforms. Fraudsters may pose as human resource employees or other representatives from well-known companies in order to gain your trust and convince you that their job offer is legitimate. As always — if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If you believe you've received a fake job offer message, report it to the site owners and delete it immediately. If you know someone who is looking for work, pass along this message so they can be aware of some of the red flags of recruiting scams.</p>

192,"<h1>Fraud Talk: Fraud Now, Pay Later</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>In this episode of Fraud Talk, Jim Ducharme, COO of Outseer, a leading technology company in the fight against payment fraud, talks about the rise of ""Buy Now, Pay Later"" services and how fraudsters are exploiting these new avenues of credit. He also discusses identity assurance and how companies are working to combat payment fraud without adding hurdles for consumers.</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>In the excerpt below from <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/podcast/podcast-detail?s=fraud-now-pay-later"">episode 118</a>, Jim talks with Rihonna Scoggins, ACFE Community Manager, about how Buy Now, Pay Later services are being exploited through identity theft.</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Rihonna: </strong>With these Buy Now, Pay Later services, they can be incredibly alluring to people who may have poor credit history or for other reasons they might not qualify for typical credit cards, but that allure extends to fraudsters, right?</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Jim: </strong>Well, what's really alluring to fraudsters is that there's a whole new attack pattern to steal your money. When a Buy Now, Pay Later transaction happens, and what can be a little bit different than your traditional credit card, when you're using that credit card online, you've already established a relationship with your bank, they've extended your credit line, and they've given you a credit card. Many of these buy now pay later forms you can establish an account with them as you're purchasing something.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If you're purchasing something online and you choose one of these Buy Now, Pay Later options, you're actually enrolling, basically creating that account while you're checking out. What the fraudsters are doing is actually taking advantage of rather than taking advantage of the payment fraud, they're actually taking advantage of the account enrollment part of it. In other words, establishing that account with the Buy Now, Pay Later vendor, or even with a credit card provider.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What they're doing is they basically can steal your identity to establish an account in your name, but have the goods or services delivered to them. Really, it just adds another risk factor to how fraudsters can steal your stuff. Again, rather than steal your credit card numbers, which is an established account with your bank, they can try to steal your identity open an account with one of these Buy Now, Pay Later options and complete the transaction, have the goods shipped to them. That's what's appealing to the fraudsters, is a new vulnerable spot in the payment method.</p>

193,<h1>Crocodile of Wall Street Rendered Toothless as Authorities Bite Back</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Martin Kenney, managing partner with Martin Kenney &amp; Co., Solicitors</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The sums involved in the latest high-profile cryptocurrency fraud are mind-blowing. A self-proclaimed amateur rapper nicknamed the “Crocodile of Wall Street,” Heather Morgan, along with her husband Ilya Lichtenstein, were arrested and charged with <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency"">conspiracy to allegedly launder $4.5 billion</a> in stolen Bitcoin last month.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Equally astonishing is the success of the U.S. Justice Department in retrieving assets in this case — it has reportedly recovered $3.6 billion of the digital currency after seizing the couple’s digital wallets. While this still leaves approximately $1 billion outstanding, it remains a tremendous feat. One can only hope that the recovery will continue to grow in size as the investigation develops.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The couple, bailed for $8 million between them, are alleged to have laundered huge sums of Bitcoin stolen in a 2016 hack. The hacker, which the DOJ has not claimed was either Morgan or Lichtenstein, targeted <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/how-a-young-couple-failed-to-launder-billions-of-dollars-in-stolen-bitcoin"">a coin exchange called Bitfinex</a>, stealing 119,754 bitcoins. The theft was so significant that it knocked 20% off the value of Bitcoin after the news of the hack broke.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""> Equally staggering is the value of hack—originally around $71 million—which has shot up in a comparatively short number of years, owing to the volatile upward growth in Bitcoin’s value. The fact that the U.S. authorities were able to track the Bitcoin movements here is testament that digital currencies are no longer the opaque tender they once were, which gives asset recovery specialists cause for hope as we move forward.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said of the events, “Today’s arrests, and the Department’s largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Comments by U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia were particularly interesting, illustrating a change in position by the authorities toward digital currencies. Graves said that such thefts as those alleged by Lichtenstein and Morgan “could undermine confidence in cryptocurrency.” The underlying message appears to signal a seismic shift in attitude toward digital currencies — from representing all that is wrong with the world of money laundering to a point where U.S. officials are concerned about digital currency platforms being damaged by hacks.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Digital currencies are becoming increasingly common. Companies such as Tesla <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60001144"">now accept certain digital currencies</a> as a form of payment (in this case Dogecoin, which can be used to buy Tesla merchandise). As their popularity grows, those who once robbed banks will likely swap their shotguns and masks for computers and high-powered servers to enact their crimes.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As they do, those who track assets are already penetrating the layers by which such crooks seek to hide their loot. “Chain Hopping” — the process of moving and shifting digital currency in an attempt to befuddle those seeking to follow money laundering chains — is no different notionally than the placing, layering and integration that anti-money laundering specialists are familiar with. Fortunately, it is possible to track digital currency movements, with outfits such as <a href=""https://www.chainalysis.com"">Chainalysis</a> and other experts now leading the way in the field.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The investigators involved in the Lichtenstein/Morgan case should be congratulated for their efforts. If their suspicions are proven to be correct, the couple’s prosecution will serve as a deterrent to others of a similar ilk. The recovery of the billions of dollars in value sends a further message: If you are going to commit such crimes, not only will you stand to lose your liberty, but your ill-gotten gains can and will be targeted too. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Crime must not pay, and our best weapon against crime is having meaningful deterrents that can be employed by those with the skills and determination to implement them, including confiscation of wealth.</p>

194,"<h1>Member Spotlight: Diana Muyibi, Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship Recipient</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Diana Muyibi is a graduate student studying at State University of New York (SUNY), Old Westbury and also a proud past recipient of the ACFE’s Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Diana is in the Master of Science in forensic accounting program and is expected to graduate this spring. Currently, she is a member of the Long Island Chapter of the ACFE, the National Association of Black Accountants and the National Society of Collegiate Scholars, and she participates as a volunteer for the Justice for Fraud Victims Project at SUNY Old Westbury along with other programs. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you hear about the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship and what made you decide to apply?  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I was initially informed about the ACFE and the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship by my professor, Dr. David Glodstein, CFE, CPA, who played a major role in motivating and encouraging me to apply for the scholarship. After enrolling in fraud examination and white-collar crime courses with him, I decided to change my major from the M.S. in accounting program at SUNY Old Westbury to forensic accounting. The course material was very engaging, and my professor was a key proponent of my desire to delve deeply into the theories and components of fraud examination, deterrence and detection. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To this day, I am still enthused after being selected as a recipient of the Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship. It was the first scholarship that I had ever applied for, and being selected as the top recipient was an accomplishment that I will never forget and will forever be grateful for. I celebrated the great news with Dr. Glodstein, my classmates, SUNY Old Westbury’s school of business, the Nassau County District Attorney’s Office in Long Island and my wonderful family, who continue to motivate me and my passion for the forensic accounting and fraud examination profession. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become passionate about fighting fraud?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""> I became passionate about fighting fraud after learning about who the victims of fraud are and understanding how fraud and financial accounting scandals impact us all. It is important to note that there are both direct and indirect victims of fraud. Indirect victims of fraud include the families of perpetrators who rely on the financial responsibilities associated with ill-gotten gains. As I reflected on my childhood experiences, I realized that I too had been a victim of fraud; protecting potential victims from these experiences is what fuels my desire for this profession. Participating in the Justice for Fraud Victim’s Project at SUNY Old Westbury, reaching out to local underrepresented communities and small businesses that may have been impacted by fraud, has been a fulfilling experience. It is important that I continue to dedicate my assistance to this initiative because not only will it aid in spreading awareness of the importance of fraud detection and prevention, but it will also prevent people from experiencing the harsh impacts of fraud and the same financial hardships that I did in my childhood. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How do you balance your volunteer work with your graduate program and anti-fraud work?  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Time management is an important skill I have developed with balancing the demands from my graduate program and anti-fraud work. As a member of the ACFE’s Long Island Chapter, the National Association of Black Accountants and the National Society of Collegiate Scholars, I participated in the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and TCE program, where I gave tax preparation assistance to demographic groups who may be vulnerable to tax fraud. As previously mentioned, I am also a volunteer in the Justice for Fraud Victim's Project at SUNY Old Westbury. In conjunction with the applied learning aspect of my graduate program in forensic accounting and my anti-fraud work, these programs have allowed me to participate in organizations that provide experiential based learning when confronting real world complications that are associated with fraud investigation and white-collar crime. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What are some things you hope to accomplish in the anti-fraud field? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I am currently studying for the CFE exam and am looking forward to obtaining my credential and engaging as an expert witness in the months to come. This would signify a major short-term accomplishment for me in the anti-fraud field. Long-term and over the span of my career, I aim toward becoming a skilled pioneer in this profession and plan on mentoring, motivating and inspiring future fraud fighters who are interested in developing skills related to the anti-fraud profession. For this to be possible, it is important that I continue to develop and utilize accounting, auditing and investigative techniques to become a dynamic and experienced leader in this profession.   </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What advice do you have for students who are interested in applying for the scholarship? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">For current students who are interested in applying for the ACFE’s Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship, I would recommend that they build relationships with their professors and members of their community who are dedicated to the anti-fraud profession. These people have years of experience offering guidance to past graduates and professionals who have gone on to be pioneers in their respective fields. These connections will provide students with opportunities to expand their own network and position themselves for success in their prospective anti-fraud careers.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The anti-fraud profession is a very rewarding career path, and it can be extremely fulfilling to those who are passionate about assisting both their community and businesses that may have been impacted by fraud. The ACFE’s Ritchie-Jennings Memorial Scholarship offers great benefits that assist students with covering tuition and fees. As an added incentive, the scholarship also awards a one-year ACFE Student Membership that provides students with the ability to expand their network and directly engage with professionals in the anti-fraud field. Being recognized by the ACFE Foundation has been an honor and a great privilege and, as a member, I will forever be motivated by its service to the global community and anti-fraud professionals around the world. </p>

195,<h1>Fraud Talk: Following the Breadcrumbs-Tracing Cryptocurrencies in Fraud Investigations</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<em>In this episode, Larry Nielsen, a detective who has spent the last several years teaching himself about cryptocurrencies, shares advice for fraud examiners who are interested in expanding their toolkits to accommodate cryptocurrency investigations. He also discusses some of his experiences tracing cryptocurrencies in both a law enforcement capacity and as a consultant.<br/>
<br/>
In the excerpt below from <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/podcast/podcast-detail?s=tracing-cryptocurrencies-in-fraud-investigations"">episode 117</a>, Larry talks with Mason Wilder, CFE, about how prevalent cryptocurrency is in his fraud work, and how crypto is being used in traditional crime as a new medium.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Nielsen</strong>: I'm just going to make this real simple and I'll tell you that last year in 2021, I don't believe a single day went by that I didn't have at least one cryptocurrency-related crime that I was investigating now. I don't mean that I got a new crime each day, but it was just, I don't think a day went by that. I wasn't at least investigating one, and most of the time I had multiple cases that I was looking at involving cryptocurrency.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Wilder</strong>: Can you walk us through some of the types or give us some examples, you don't have to get too specific on details or get yourself in trouble or anything, but what are some of the investigations that you've seen in the last year?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Nielsen</strong>: No, that's okay. A lot of the scams and fraud cases that you would see with regular Fiat currency, they translate right over to cryptocurrency. The bad actors are changing the media from Fiat to crypto but for example, the romance scam cases, the grandparent scam cases. Now let's say instead of they still do the Fiat currency, but for the crypto ones instead of them calling a grandparent on the phone and saying, ""Hey, we have your grandson here. He has been arrested, you need to go wire us $10,000 from your bank to this bank account and we'll let him go,” instead of that, now they're saying, “Hey, you need to go to this Bitcoin kiosk this cryptocurrency and you need to send us X amount of Bitcoin,” for example. They send it to another, they give them a wallet address to send it to, that's one example, and then we have the SIM swap cases where it's just a straight-up theft of someone else's cryptocurrency, again, it's traditional crimes, but a different medium.

196,<h1>Mentoring Success Story: Holly and Caroline</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The ACFE Mentoring Program connects members to anti-fraud professionals from all over the world who can offer a wealth of resources, experience, advice and guidance. Mentees can search among registered mentors to find individuals whose experience and expertise match the areas in which they wish to be mentored. Caroline Kaye initially reached out to Holly Atkins, CFE, after viewing her mentor profile on the ACFE Community, and since then the pair have been connecting through their personal and professional experience. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This is Holly and Caroline’s mentoring story. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become interested in fraud and what is your current role?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Holly:</strong> I was part of a team that identified $7 million in fraud over a 4-year period and from then on, I knew I wanted to continue finding inconsistencies and helping departments do things the right way.  Currently, I am a global senior manager of internal audit for Swissport International. I am responsible for audit activities within North America and Latin America.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Caroline:</strong> I am currently a senior accountant in the corporate accounting department at Humana Inc. I became interested in fraud while employed at a public accounting firm and being involved in multiple audits. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Why was it important for both of you to join the ACFE’s Mentoring Program?   </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Holly:</strong> I love meeting new people and helping wherever I can. If my experiences and suggestions can help someone else in their job that's a plus. I also find that I learn a lot being a mentor as well. It helps me understand different personalities better and become more educated in different fields I wouldn't normally be exposed to, which is fun. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Caroline:</strong> It was important for me to join the Mentoring Program to gain more exposure to professionals working in the fraud industry. I also wanted to have someone who could keep me accountable for studying for the CFE exam and could help me figure out how I could use my credentials and knowledge in my current job. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Caroline, what were you looking for in a mentor? What inspired you to request Holly? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong> Caroline:</strong> I was looking for someone who had experience in health care fraud as I work in the health care/insurance industry. I also was looking for someone who had been a mentor before and would be able to give helpful guidance as I set up study plans. After looking at Holly's profile, she seemed like someone who had experience in my industry and would hopefully know how I could apply being a CFE to that field. Her profile listed a lot of experience and accolades which pointed to her years working in fraud and auditing. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Holly, how did you know Caroline would be the right mentee for your experience and skillset?  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Holly:</strong> When I reviewed Caroline's profile, I saw a professional that wanted to grow and learn. To me that meant she wanted to make sure she was doing things right and that was important. Also, when we first spoke, we had similar interests and personalities, so it was an easy fit.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What advice do you both have for anyone who wants to join the ACFE Mentoring Program?  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Holly:</strong> If you are going to do the mentor program, make sure you choose someone you can talk to and be comfortable with. It might be a professional contact, but your personal life does impact that so make sure you're both on the same page on what you want to do and where you want to be. If the first person doesn't work out, that doesn't mean the second one you choose will be a bad partnership also.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Caroline:</strong> I say do it! Look into mentors who you think could be a good fit and just reach out. You will gain more from the experience than you can possibly imagine. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What has been the most rewarding part of your journey together?  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Holly:</strong> Knowing that Caroline is aware she can reach out with any questions — and when she passes the CFE it will be because she was committed and worked really hard. I love seeing how proud people are when they pass the CFE. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Caroline:</strong> The most rewarding part has been getting to know Holly. Every time we meet, we spend time talking about our lives and families. Holly has given me great career advice, but more than that, she has been such a support system as I've had to push back studying for my growing family. She never once has made me feel like a failure for not meeting my original test taking goal, but instead was a great support for helping me get back on track. We've really developed a great relationship that will carry on after our official mentorship is over. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Is there any advice you could give to other women in the anti-fraud profession, or who are looking to get into the industry?   </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Holly:</strong> Seeing women in auditing and investigations is a lot more common now which is great! Lean on each other, be curious, ask questions and don’t feel like you’re “less than” when you ask for help. Nobody gets anywhere alone, and we should all be supportive of those who wish to do more. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Caroline:</strong> My advice would be to not be afraid to go for what you want. The number of women in the field is growing, but there is still a long way to go to be equal. Also, I would encourage anyone who is looking to get into the industry to look into a local chapter. You'll meet so many people from different career paths who can become great resources for being in the fraud industry. </p>

197,<h1>Are You Ready to Seize Some Cryptocurrency?</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Mason Wilder,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in early February 2022 that they had <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency"">arrested two individuals</a>, Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan. When the couple was arrested in connection with the theft of cryptocurrency from the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange in 2016 and subsequent laundering of the proceeds, it led to one of the most valuable seizures of illicit proceeds in law enforcement history. It also drew the public’s attention with many poking fun at the couple’s personas as crypto-caricatures and Morgan’s “Razzlekhan” alter ego, star of numerous “sexy horror comedy” rap videos. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As tempting as it is to pile on, there is a bigger and more important message in the context of this salacious story — if fraud examiners want to succeed in recovering fraud losses going forward, they’re going to need to be prepared to identify cryptocurrency involvement in schemes, trace the related transactions and then acquire court orders that might include the seizure of digital assets.   </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The official figure featured in most headlines related to the couple’s arrest was $3.6 billion in cryptocurrency. While that eye-popping amount distorts the scale of the original crime (the stolen cryptocurrency was only worth $71 million at the time), it should serve as a warning for criminals who believe that transacting in cryptocurrency will protect their ill-gotten loot. Furthermore, it should encourage other law enforcement agencies and agents to develop the tracing and seizure protocols that could help them recover such a windfall.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In 2021, cryptocurrency addresses, or digital wallets known to be associated with illicit activity, took in $14 billion worth of cryptocurrency — which was a 79% increase from 2020 <a href=""https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/"">according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.</a> Although that figure represents only a miniscule fraction of the $15.8 trillion total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021, illustrating that while the vast majority of activity is not illicit, it is still a huge amount of funds that could potentially be targeted by authorities in recovery efforts. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">High-profile seizures of cryptocurrency funds related to crimes are a recent phenomenon, but far from unprecedented. During the fiscal year 2021, 93% of the assets seized by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) <a href=""https://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2021/irs-seizes-3-5b-in-crypto-in-fy-2021/"">were cryptocurrencies</a>. Valued at a total of $3.5 billion, almost one-third of that total came from the seizure of funds related to the original Silk Road dark web marketplace. Other notable cases contributing to the IRS’s 2021 cryptocurrency haul included a Microsoft software developer’s insider fraud, and the operator of a dark web money laundering service named Bitcoin Fog that handled more than 1 billion bitcoins.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another newsworthy seizure of illicit cryptocurrency occurred in June 2021 when the DOJ <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside"">seized</a> 63.7 bitcoins, then valued at $2.3 million, that were paid to criminals who carried out a ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Several of these law enforcement seizures occurred after the agencies reportedly obtained digital files that included private encryption keys the agencies used to access digital wallets and transfer cryptocurrency into their control. Many jurisdictions now require cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallet providers and other cryptocurrency-related money services to implement anti-money laundering (AML) controls and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols to collect information about their customers that can be targeted in court orders. However, turning over custody of a customer’s cryptocurrency is not a common practice since many jurisdictions classify cryptocurrency differently or have not yet settled regulations related to cryptocurrency’s status as property or currency.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Public and private organizations are responding to this increase in cryptocurrency utilization by criminals; shortly after the arrest of Lichtenstein and Morgan, the DOJ <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-first-director-national-cryptocurrency-enforcement-team"">announced</a> a new National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to combat the use of digital assets in crimes. Private companies such as CipherTrace, Chainalysis, Maltego, Palantir and others are rapidly developing and expanding cryptocurrency-related capabilities like tracing and blockchain forensics, with some of them offering certificate programs.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud examiners in both the public and private sectors can expect to encounter cryptocurrencies as the technology is more broadly adopted. If they are not prepared to identify, trace and recover illicit cryptocurrency they will be missing out on the chance to participate in a seizure like those mentioned above. If they do not seek out training or educate themselves on this emerging anti-fraud field and stay up to date with regulations and legal precedents it may be to the detriment of their employers or clients.</p>

198,"<h1>90-Day CFE Exam Challenge Success Story: Abigail Zieglar, CFE</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Abigail first began her career in banking as a service representative in a branch where she was later able to transition to a loan auditor specializing in small business loans. Abigail had her first introduction to the fraud industry when a former coworker referred her to an open position at their health insurance company. Later she began her work as a Fraud Coordinator in 2018 and since has made the transition to becoming a Fraud Analyst. In 2021, Abigail joined the <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/cfe-exam-preparation/90-day-cfe-exam-challenge"">90-Day CFE Exam Challenge</a>, where she was able to study and pass her exams within 90 days.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Why did you join the 90-Day CFE Exam Challenge?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I wanted a way to stay on track and be held accountable. I also wanted to receive study tips, test taking tips and overall motivation from others. I was nervous to begin the process but hearing from others who were in the same position as me or were new CFE’s really boosted my confidence!</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What did your study method look like?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">After I took the practice test to determine the order of studying each section, I began looking at the questions in the CFE Prep Course. I studied my strongest section first and ended with my weakest section. All of these tips were provided in the 90-day challenge group! Every question taken in the prep course provided a paragraph or short sentence after the question which stated the reasoning as to why a question was right or wrong, along with the page number in the Fraud Examiner Manual for where you can read further about the question/topic. For me, I took hand-written notes in a notebook for every question taken in the prep course. I really focused on the reasonings to why a question was right or wrong, and pulled out the Fraud Examiner Manual if I needed further clarification on a topic. As for the length of time I would study each day, I would try to study between 1-2 hours every day. If I had extra time, I would try to study a little more. I would take breaks when I noticed I was getting distracted or if I needed to step away to do every day “life” things. There were a few days where I was traveling or days where I had events I needed to attend, so studying became more difficult. On days like that, I had a plan to read for a few minutes through my hand-written notes. Lastly, I checked the 90-day discussion forum at the end of every day. It helped me realize other people experienced the ups and downs of the study process, but also provided continued study tips and motivation!</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did the challenge help you accomplish your goal of passing the CFE Exam?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There was so much positivity in this challenge group! Between other challengers and CFE’s providing tips and motivation, I felt there was nothing I could not accomplish. No matter what emotions I felt throughout the process, I knew there were other people in the challenge group that felt the same way as me. The challenge group wants to see people succeed and it provided me with the confidence to keep going!</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What did it feel like when you got the email saying you'd passed? How did you celebrate?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I was so excited, but more so proud of myself for following through! I will admit I doubted myself at times throughout the process, but I continued to listen and engage in the challenge group. Receiving that passing email was extremely rewarding and relieving! I celebrated by going to one of my favorite Italian restaurants!</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What advice do you have for challenge participants who are preparing for the CFE Exam?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Engage in the challenge group! Ask questions, read directions and tips, provide feedback and take deep breaths. They want to see you succeed as much as you want to! </p>

199,<h1>Charity Fraud: How to Donate Without Becoming a Victim of a Scam</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Giancarlo Berrocal, CFE</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How many times have you seen an ad on social media asking you to donate to a cause? The reality is that many of us have a generous heart that prompts us to act and promote just causes like increasing research to fight breast cancer, protecting the environment or providing natural disaster aid in a developing country. Our natural tendency is to sympathize with these causes, which often compels us to donate money and/or property. Unfortunately, not all causes we are called to join have a noble motive; some of them are organized by unscrupulous individuals who take advantage of our generosity to steal our money. But how can you donate without being a victim of a charity scam? Is there a bulletproof way to give you the peace of mind that your contributions are going to the desired cause? </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">According to Giving USA’s <a href=""https://store.givingusa.org/products/2021-annual-report?variant=39329211613263"">2021 annual report</a>, Americans (individuals and corporations) gave around $471 billion to charity in 2021. To put it into perspective, America’s generous giving is more than Austria’s gross domestic product. Typically, generosity is a sign of a nation’s prosperity and good values, especially in difficult economic times. Nonetheless, giving to charity also poses certain risks and challenges. The <a href=""https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf"">FBI’s 2020 IC3 Annual Report</a> showed an increase in charity fraud cases in recent years. Reported charity fraud accounted for $4.4 million in losses, which has increased more than twofold since 2018. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Charity fraud is not only financially detrimental to donors, but also to an individual’s trust in charitable organizations, which affects legitimate charities. According to the <a href=""https://www.give.org/docs/default-source/donor-trust-library/2021-donor-trust-report.pdf"">Give.org Donor Trust Report 2021</a>, “Trust is considered highly important in the giving process. However, self-reported reliance on trust as a giving indicator has eroded over the past 4 years.”</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">According to the <a href=""https://give.org/docs/default-source/donor-trust-library/2020-donor-trust-report.pdf"">Donor Trust Report 2020</a>, individuals are more likely to trust a charitable organization when they exhibit the following factors: evaluation by a third-party independent organization, name recognition and accomplishments shared by the organization. However, these factors alone may not be enough to prevent and deter charity fraud. There are certain red flags you should pay attention to in order to avoid being a victim of this type of scam. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Red Flags of Charity Fraud</h2>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Pressure to donate</strong> — Fraudsters will try to instill a “sense of urgency” in the victim’s mind to make them donate immediately. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>New charitable organization</strong> — Some scammers will create an organization after a major event (earthquake, COVID-19 pandemic, etc.) for the purpose of defrauding individuals. Typically, the name of the organization cannot be found online using basic online searching tools.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Use of certain payment methods</strong> — Scammers usually prefer cryptocurrencies, gift cards and wire transfers as a form of payment to receive donations. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Less than 65% of donations go to intended cause</strong> — BBB Wise Giving Alliance recommends that any charitable organization should spend at least 65% proceeds in charity’s program activities.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Use of robocalls/automated calls</strong> — Be suspicious of robocalls trying to raise money. These robocalls are most likely scams.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Negative media/reviews</strong> — If a charitable organization is being flagged in social media or the press for dubious practices or scams/fraudulent conduct, then you should refrain from making any donation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Steps to Avoid Charity Scams</h2>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Look up the organization’s website to verify its authenticity. Do not click on links or download attachments sent by a purported organization via email/texts.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Be aware of crowdfunding — if a person is raising money using crowdfunding campaign through a fundraising platform such as GoFundMe, make sure you know or trust the person who is behind the campaign. Crowdfunding is easy to set up and the legitimacy of the fundraising campaign is difficult to verify.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Use online resources to verify the charitable organization’s review and credibility. You can use these free resources such as Charity Watch, Charity Navigator, and BBB Wise Giving Alliance.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Use a check or credit card to make your donations. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Look at the charitable organization’s IRS tax exempt status. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Verify the charitable organization’s registration status in your state. </li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How to Report Charity Fraud</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If you become a victim of charity fraud, report your case immediately to:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Federal Trade Commission </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">National Center for Disaster Fraud </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The FBI </li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Also, contact your State Consumer Protection Office.</p>

200,"<h1>Member Spotlight: Michael Mingo-Dabney, CFE</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Rihonna Scoggins </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>Michael Mingo-Dabney, CFE, began his career as an anti-fraud professional after learning about the prevalent embezzlement and money laundering corrupting a town in Colombia while serving as a volunteer for the Peace Corps. Michael continues his work against fraud as a fraud analyst for C2 Alaska, as well as serving as a contractor for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Enforcement.</em></p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become passionate about fighting fraud?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">My passion for anti-fraud efforts stemmed from my interest in international economic development, which I studied at George Mason University (GMU) with a minor in economics. My favorite courses were the development-based subjects centered on African and Latin American nations. A major component of why economic development never seemed to have the impact it was meant to have — despite billions of investment from first-world nations — was because of funds “slipping through the cracks” into the hands of politicians and corrupt officials. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fast forward to July 2017 when I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Colombia. After I was assigned my town of service and relocated to Tomarrazon, La Guajira, I heard countless stories from my site mate and locals about how certain institutions installed in the pueblos (small towns) were no longer in service due to a lack of necessary funding. Some personal investigating led me to discover there had been an exorbitant amount of fraudulent activity happening for quite some time. When I spoke to locals in Tomarrazon and the capital city of Riohacha, combined with some resources at the mayor’s office, I found articles about officials being arrested for embezzlement and money laundering. Seeing the negative impact of those embezzled funds, which were supposed to go to local schools but were instead used for luxury purchases and political bribes, broke my heart. Simultaneously, it sparked a fire in me to do what I could to combat that sort of activity. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you get to your current role?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The path to my current role could be described as fumbling my way through life as an overzealous brute wanting to take down anything and everything that resembled fraud. After leaving the Peace Corps, I knew that I wanted to have a career in fighting fraud — the only question was how? </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Almost immediately, I explored going back to school to study accounting. I ended up going back to GMU and applying for a graduate certificate in forensic accounting. I knew I had made the right choice when I got accepted and started my courses. The technical and soft skills I learned in that program will stay with me forever. I also found a lifelong mentor in a professor during that time, and he has advised me ever since. When we would speak during office hours about what I wanted to do, he saw the internal fire I had and worked with me to achieve my goal. During one of his courses, I learned about the CFE credential.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As I studied, I was also working as a contracted auditor at a Big Four firm. I liked audit, as it was the first real experience that allowed me to utilize the skills I was learning from my graduate courses. But audit only allowed me to point out the problems, not be a part of the solution. So, I left that position and joined a boutique litigation consulting firm as a forensic cost consultant. In that role, I was able to apply all my forensic accounting knowledge, while learning soft skills; at the time, I seriously underestimated the importance of those soft skills that have since enabled me to mature professionally. While working for the consulting firm, I studied for and passed the CFE exams. Having the CFE is what led me to obtain the position that I have now as a fraud analyst II for C2 Alaska. I serve as a contractor for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Enforcement – Office of Investigation and Market Analytics.What are challenges you face as a fraud analyst?</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The biggest challenge is staying ahead of the curve. As much we hate to admit it, fraudsters are incredibly intelligent people. Their creative ways of thinking and utilizing everyday programs and tools never cease to fascinate me. The diverse methods of committing fraud that go beyond what we learned about in graduate school prove to be a challenge every day. Though it can be frustrating, it's also equally fun to play the game and keep up with, and attempt to stay one step ahead, of them. It forces me to learn things I never knew I would need to — for instance, how to think like a fraudster. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The more I uncover in my work, the more I find myself reading about what those who have come before me have experienced. Books like “Why They Do It” by Eugene Soltes and “The Other Side of Yesterday” by Gary A. Foster have changed my foundational thinking. I do my best every day to take the lessons from books like these and apply them to a modern way of thinking in order to combat the growing popularity of ""new"" methods of fraud like cryptocurrency fraud. I've gradually steered further and further away from the typical accounting financial statements and closer to the digital asset realm. Thus, self-teaching to stay ahead is a challenge I both enjoy and endure. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is an important lesson you’ve learned in your career?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The most important lesson I’ve learned throughout every step of my career is that imperfection is okay. From my sophomore year of college until I graduated and first experienced the “real world,” I was a perfectionist. So much so that it proved to be detrimental to professional relationships I tried to cultivate. I’ve always had high standards for myself; thus, when I worked with others, I projected those expectations of perfection on them as well. In every role that I’ve held, from internships to my current one, I’ve learned from the people who have mentored me and whom I’ve worked alongside. Each of them, gradually, softened my abrasive exterior and made me easier to work with. In addition, they taught me to make space for accepting mistakes, as long as I learned from them and never made the same one twice.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As an African American in this field, I face subtle but unrelenting pressures to compete with my peers and be among the best — if I am not the best myself. It’s common for those of us in the African American community to impose pressures on ourselves in addition to those placed on us by our superiors and peers. Working in the increasingly diverse field of accounting and anti-fraud has encouraged me to be a sponge and learn from those around me. I’ve found that adopting other methods of thinking to my own has allowed me to progress in my career at a much faster rate than that perfectionist version of myself ever could have. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is important to you about being a CFE?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Obtaining the CFE credential was a professional milestone. It was more than a credential to me — it was a representation of what I wanted, and still want, to become. I believe the CFE represents a lifestyle choice. Those who have chosen to dedicate their lives to fighting fraud stand as a line of defense for victims of monetary deceit. Being a CFE means that we represent not only ourselves, but also those who trust us as professionals to operate in their best interests and to ensure the prosecution of those who don't. It is a commitment to myself and those people that I give my best effort every day. That no matter what challenges I face, I will overcome them and use those lessons to teach those who come after me.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>ACFE membership is open to individuals of all job functions, industries and levels of experience who are interested in the prevention, detection and deterrence of fraud. If you want to level up your anti-fraud career, we can help.</em></p>

201,<h1>5 Steps to Safeguard Your Business from Cyberattacks and Fraud in 2022</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Eoin Pigott, Business Development Associate for <a href=""https://wisetek.net/"">Wisetek</a></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><a href=""https://wisetek.net/""></a>In today’s modern age, almost every business is dependent on the internet and information technology to accomplish a variety of daily operational tasks. From emails to e-commerce and e-banking,  sensitive business activities are conducted via the internet. While the internet has undoubtedly made it easier for businesses of all shapes and sizes to operate, it has also made it easier for cybercriminals to gain access to confidential information and systems.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Many entrepreneurs and companies falsely believe that cybercriminals only target large companies. The fact is that cybercrime across all businesses is on the rise — and cybercriminals are not particularly picky about who or what they target. Ransomware attacks are amongst the many tactics that cybercriminals use most often, and these attacks can have devastating consequences for companies. The first steps to safeguarding your business against cybercrimes and fraud is to understand that every business is at risk and to take this risk seriously.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There are a few simple practices that you can implement in your business to lower the risk of becoming another cybercrime statistic. These practices include: </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Underscoring that cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We often think of cybersecurity as the responsibility of the IT department, but the truth is that cybersecurity is everyone’s business. Make sure that teams are trained to identify possible signs of a hacking attempt as not all cybercrimes are complicated plots. In many cases, something as simple as a misspelled email address can open the door for a cybercriminal to gain access to your systems. Having regular meetings or workshops on the topic of cybersecurity can equip team members with the basic skills that they need to identify and avoid common cybercrime risks. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Protecting data by encrypting it</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Data is one of the most valuable assets that a business can have and protecting it is the ultimate goal of every IT security plan. One of the best ways in which data can be protected is by encrypting it. While encrypted data can still be stolen by a hacker, the data is rendered useless because it cannot be read by cybercriminals. The best-case scenario is always preventing criminals from gaining access to data in the first place, but if a cybercriminal should gain access to data, encryption provides a secondary layer of protection.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Selectively storing data</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the past, companies tended to collect and store as much data on their customers as they possibly could. The problem with this approach is that it might lead to the collection of unnecessary, and confidential, data. For example, storing the credit card details or birth date of a customer unless it is absolutely needed does not make much sense. It is important to regularly go through data stores and take inventory of what is needed and what can be securely destroyed through <a href=""https://wisetek.net/services-overview/data-destruction/"">data destruction</a>. The less data you hold, the lower the risk of being hacked becomes. In addition to this, legislation such as GDPR clearly states that data may only be held for a specific purpose. By clearing your servers of unnecessary data, you also reduce the possibility of not complying with data privacy laws.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Using artificial intelligence to your advantage</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Artificial intelligence (AI) can be a powerful tool in the fight to secure your data. More sophisticated cyberattacks are not always readily detectable by humans and a little help from AI-powered technology goes a long way towards keeping your data safe. AI represents the next level in data security, and it is something that no business should be without. Make sure that your anti-virus, anti-malware and firewall service providers use AI in their products to ensure that attempted cyberattacks are detected before they can cause problems.  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Investing in cybersecurity</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While keeping tabs on costs is a key task in any business, there are some areas in which you should not skimp — and cybersecurity is one of those areas. Make sure that you invest in the best possible digital security products that you can afford and hire the best digital security experts that you can find to keep an eye on things. Investing in proper cybersecurity tools today can save you from significant financial losses later down the line. Many cybersecurity products are available — such as subscription-based products — which may reduce the cost for smaller companies. However, it is important to remember that your cybersecurity begins and ends with your team, so investing in good staff and training is one of the best ways to keep your data safe.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Cybersecurity is already a worldwide problem and it is only going to evolve with time. With this in mind, every business should work towards improving their cybersecurity and develop policies to protect their data, and educate employees on the risks of cybercrime and how to avoid becoming victims.  </p>

202,<h1>Safeguarding American Investors and Consumers</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Dr. Maria Tsennykh, Managing Director at Weaver</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Classic free-market theory holds that buyers and sellers act as if they are guided by an “invisible hand” that help produce the best outcome — a better outcome than government oversight could ever produce. While economists debate the scope, scale and specific roles for appropriate government intervention, fraud continues. One recent high-profile case is the trial over allegations against a private company, Theranos, founded by Elizabeth Holmes — but this is far from the only case.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A simple internet search for “American fraudsters” or “Americans convicted of fraud” reveals more than 200 large scandals during recent decades. Even if you exclude small-scale fraud and non-white-collar crimes, there are approximately 90 large business-related fraud scandals since 1970.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the wake of the Enron and WorldCom scandals, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002. It offered protection for whistleblowers at public companies, encouraging people to report suspected fraud. In addition, the Supreme Court has ruled that people performing services for public companies, even if they’re not employees, are also protected by SOX. However, SOX does not apply to private companies. There has been ongoing debate, but so far there has been no action to apply similar protections to private companies that sell services or products directly to consumers and attract investor capital.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Recommendations</h2>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Protecting whistleblowers and building cultures of transparency </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">For public companies, whistleblower hotlines provide compliance departments with opportunities to prevent potential legal issues. In my experience working with private companies, I have found that many do not have a hotline. In addition, many companies require employees to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), and employees often fear that reporting fraud will lead to being sued for violating the NDA. In companies without a strong culture of compliance, transparency and trust — including regular compliance training — employees may stay silent to protect their careers and prevent lawsuits. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Until all potential whistleblowers feel safe within private organizations, American society and investors remain vulnerable to future fraud and large scandals. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In most cases, the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) reports to the CEO or General Counsel. For example, even if Theranos had a robust compliance department, the CCO leading the team would most likely have reported to Elizabeth Holmes directly — giving her the opportunity to bury any evidence of fraud. To be effective, CCOs should have owner-type stake in the company or should be able to report to a broader range of stakeholders — such as the board of directors and independent board members. That way, it would be more difficult for a rogue CEO to hide fraud.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the SEC adopted additional whistleblower rewards programs that also apply to private subsidiaries of public corporations. For example, private subsidiaries are now subject to some of the whistleblower requirements under the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and the Consumer Protection Act.  However, there is a collective sentiment that these requirements are not sufficient. For real reform, the SEC should adopt stiffer requirements and clearer penalties, as well as provide greater clarity about violations that may result in sanctions for cases of less than $1 million.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Performing pre-investment and ongoing external compliance evaluations </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Although most investors are aware of the risk-versus-return tradeoff, they should always perform uniform due diligence procedures over external compliance before investing in any private business — especially in the healthcare or technology industries. Such evaluations should be performed to the same standard as commercial due diligence and repeated annually.  </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">“Tuning” risk management processes to economic cycles</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Looking at the 90 large fraud cases over the last 50 years, the majority of fraud was caught within one year before or after a major market crash. That doesn’t mean the fraud only occurred then — just that market downturns exposed vulnerabilities and made the fraud more apparent. This proximity to market crashes points toward a problem with risk management, since they were discovered when investors were more focused on their investments. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Such a pattern indicates that if a more robust risk management process had existed during upward economic cycles, more fraud could have been identified in its earlier stages. Therefore, one lesson to learn from recent recessions is to tune risk management processes to be more aggressive during high-growth years. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A Warning to Private Companies</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Should there be a new SOX–style regulatory framework for private companies? If fraud continues to increase in scope, impact and publicity, business leaders should expect increasing political calls for more regulation. Private company leaders who want to head off such requirements should take steps to demonstrate they can regulate themselves by protecting whistleblowers, engaging in routine external compliance audits and building cultures of transparency that consumers and investors can trust.</p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">After almost 25 years in energy finance, I decided it was time for a change. My skills and experience were valuable, but I felt I was not using them for maximum effect. I was doing the same kind of work, in the same way, with the same outcome. To be blunt, I knew the skills I acquired in my line of work were important — accounting, finance, financial analysis, law, etc. — but my issue was: Why? Why am I doing this? What purpose does it serve? </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I always had an interest in forensic accounting, and the reason is simple — forensic accounting is the perfect profession for those seeking truth. I had a lot of heart for getting to the root of things, so back to school I went and picked up a graduate certificate in forensic accounting. I love it because as a forensic accountant, I can expose truth with numbers. Sometimes that truth makes people highly uncomfortable, but I’m ok with that. I fight fraud because I’m driven to prove the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">My real journey began when I was a senior banker with a great deal of Enron exposure. I always felt uneasy about the company, but I did not know why. At a Christmas party, another banker said, “people do not generally lie on their tax returns.” That got me thinking, and I decided to dig in. I did a deferred tax analysis of Enron’s reported mark-to-market earnings versus what they disclosed in their footnotes. The differences were striking — it was obvious they were lying. I wrote a memo to senior management to that effect and got subpoenaed and had to testify. That is the point I realized that speaking the truth with numbers is exceptionally important and it was where I wanted to focus my energy.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As an extension of my interest in forensic accounting work, I am active in helping to rescue refugees from life-threatening situations. Using the skills I’ve acquired along the way has helped me to be relentless in my pursuit of justice. It is both exhilarating and frustrating, but it is the most rewarding work because I can make a meaningful difference for someone who might otherwise have nowhere to turn.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I believe all fraud examiners could benefit from being involved in humanitarian work. With our training, we are uniquely qualified to find a way out. Fraud examiners are, almost by definition, creative — we have to be; that is nature of the work. My advice to other anti-fraud professionals is to find your soul and be relentless. Never give up on truth and justice. </p>

204,<h1>What You Should Know About Money Mules</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Ron Cresswell,  J.D., CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) was created in 1998 to combat cybercrime, terrorism and other forms of organized crime. Since 2016, Europol has conducted annual anti-money laundering operations known as European Money Mule Actions, or EMMA. On December 2, 2021, Europol announced the results of <a href=""https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/european-money-mule-action-leads-to-1-803-arrests"">EMMA 7</a>, which was conducted from September to November 2021 with the cooperation of 26 countries and multiple law enforcement partners, financial institutions and private-sector businesses.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">According to Europol, EMMA 7 resulted in 1,803 arrests and prevented €67.5 million in potential losses. The operation also identified 18,351 money mules. These money mules were used to launder money for various online scams, including sim-swapping, man in the middle attacks, e-commerce fraud and phishing.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As EMMA 7 illustrates, money mules continue to play a key role in international money laundering operations. Accordingly, both <a href=""https://www.europol.europa.eu/operations-services-and-innovation/public-awareness-and-prevention-guides/money-muling"">Europol</a> and the <a href=""https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2021/PSA211203"">FBI</a> have recently stepped up their efforts to raise public awareness about money mules and how to avoid becoming one.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What Are Money Mules?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A money mule is a person who transfers illegally acquired funds at the direction of a third party. Money mules generally receive a commission, in either a flat fee or percentage, for moving the money. In the most common type of money mule scheme, the criminal first deposits money into the mule’s bank account. The mule is then directed to transfer the money to another account or to withdraw the money in cash and deliver it to another party. The goal is to obscure the illegal origin of the money.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Types of Money Mules</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The FBI classifies money mules into three types: </p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Complicit mules </strong>— these individuals know that they are money mules and are complicit in the underlying criminal scheme. They might regularly open bank accounts at different financial institutions, openly advertise their services and recruit other mules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Witting mules —</strong> these are people who disregard the warning signs that they are involved in illegal activities. They might have received and ignored previous warnings from bank personnel. Many witting mules began as unwitting mules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Unwitting mules —</strong> these individuals do not know that they are involved in a criminal scheme. They might genuinely believe that their activities are helping someone (e.g., their employer, an acquaintance or their romantic partner). Unwitting mules are typically recruited as part of a scam.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How Unwitting Mules Are Recruited</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Many unwitting mules are recruited through job offers with promises of easy money or instant cash. In such cases, the potential mule may be asked to open a bank account, a cryptocurrency wallet or a business in their name. The initial communication may be an unsolicited email or instant message, a pop-up ad, or a job posting on social media, an online forum or a job website. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Another common recruiting tool is the romance scam. In a romance scam, a criminal adopts a false online identity to gain a victim’s trust and affection. The criminal then convinces the victim to receive deposits and transfer funds through the victim’s financial accounts. Unwitting mules may also be recruited through extortion or investment schemes.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While anyone can be recruited as a money mule, the most targeted groups include college students, the unemployed, newly immigrated individuals and the elderly.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How to Avoid Becoming an Unwitting Mule</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To avoid becoming an unwitting money mule, look for the following red flags:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Any request to move money through your bank account in exchange for payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A job offer that asks you to receive company funds into your personal account, or asks you to open a new bank account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An employer that claims to be an overseas company seeking a local agent or representative (often to avoid high transaction fees or local taxes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Any job posting that involves transferring money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A job posting that is poorly written, vague, does not describe the job duties, or does not include education and experience requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An acquaintance or romantic partner who asks you to receive or transfer funds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Money mules can be charged with serious crimes that include substantial fines and long prison sentences. Therefore, any request to accept or transfer funds should be treated with great suspicion.</p>

205,<h1>Elizabeth Holmes Found Guilty on Four Charges of Fraud</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Mason Wilder,  CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">After seven days of deliberations, a jury in California found Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes guilty on four out of 11 federal fraud charges on January 3, 2022; nearly four years after Holmes and Theranos agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to settle civil charges of securities fraud. Each charge carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The charges Holmes faced during her 15-week trial included nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Four of the charges (three counts of wire fraud and one of conspiracy to commit wire fraud) were related to the defrauding of patients, while the remaining seven were related to the defrauding of investors. Holmes, a former darling of Silicon Valley, managed to convince many high-profile individuals to align themselves with her supposedly revolutionary blood-testing company. A 2015 investigation into the accuracy of the blood testing technology, published by The Wall Street Journal, led to a federal investigation. Holmes was charged with fraud by the SEC in March 2018 and Theranos officially dissolved in September 2018. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The jury acquitted Holmes on all four counts related to defrauding patients and could not reach a verdict on three of the seven counts related to defrauding investors. The counts of wire fraud on which she was found guilty involved the investors PFM Healthcare Master Fund (USD 38,336,632), Lakeshore Capital Management LP (USD 99,999,984) and Mosley Family Holdings LLC (USD 5,999,997).</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Holmes is expected to appeal the convictions, but there will not be a retrial of the counts the jury could not reach agreement on since a guilty verdict on those counts would not affect her sentencing. Her sentencing has not yet been scheduled but will likely take place at least six months from now. Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, the former president and chief operating officer of Theranos, as well as Holmes’s former romantic partner, faces the same fraud charges as Holmes; his trial is set to begin February 2022.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Although Holmes’ sentencing and the fate of any appeals will be undetermined for some time, her convictions close at least one chapter of the Theranos saga.  </p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Matthew Stock, J.D., CFE, CPA, is the director of the <a href=""https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/attorneys-profile/matthew-stock-cpa/"">Whistleblower Rewards Practice</a> at Zuckerman Law. At Zuckerman Law, he leverages his experience as an attorney and external auditor to assist whistleblowers to investigate and disclose complex financial frauds to the government. His practice focuses on representing whistleblowers in reward cases before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become passionate about fighting fraud? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I first became passionate about fighting fraud after witnessing the fallout from the major accounting scandals in the early 2000s (Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Global Crossing). I decided early on to focus my education and experience on accounting and fraud detection, which led to a position as an external auditor at a Big 4 accounting firm. My passion for fighting fraud was further emboldened after the collapse of Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme and the financial crisis that cost the U.S. approximately $20 trillion. I was frustrated to learn that many of these scandals could have been detected and halted years prior to their ultimate collapses if the companies or government agencies had acted on whistleblowers’ disclosures. This prompted me to work at a whistleblower law firm after graduating from law school.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Whistleblower reward programs have proven to be a very effective tool in fighting fraud. Since the inception of the <a href=""https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/sp_faq/sec-whistleblower-program/"">SEC whistleblower program</a>, enforcement matters brought using information from whistleblowers have resulted in orders for nearly <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/2021_OW_AR_508.pdf"">$5 billion in total monetary sanctions and the return of more than $1.3 billion to harmed investors</a>. Similarly, whistleblower complaints brought under the False Claims Act have enabled the government to recover more than <a href=""https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/senators-introduce-of-bipartisan-legislation-to-fight-government-waste-fraud"">$64 billion</a>.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What are some of the biggest challenges you face in working with whistleblowers and whistleblowing cases? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">My practice focuses on representing whistleblowers in reward cases before the SEC, CFTC and IRS. Under these whistleblower programs, whistleblowers are eligible to receive up to 30% of the government’s collected monetary sanctions in a successful enforcement action as a reward. The path to obtaining a whistleblower reward is lengthy and complex, and each whistleblower program has unique rules and procedures. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While there are countless challenges and issues when reporting to the government, I frequently assist whistleblowers with the following issues:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reporting anonymously</span>: Determining whether a whistleblower can <a href=""https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/anonymous-whistleblowing-sec-whistleblower-program-protect-whistleblowers-identity/"">submit tips anonymously</a> to the government and be eligible for an award (e.g., the SEC and CFTC whistleblower programs allow whistleblowers to submit tips anonymously if represented by counsel and be eligible for an award, whereas the IRS whistleblower program does not allow whistleblowers who report anonymously to be eligible for an award).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Eligibility for a reward</span>: Determining whether a whistleblower must take certain steps before reporting to the government to be eligible for an award (e.g., the SEC whistleblower program has different eligibility rules for auditors based on their relation to the company and how they obtained the information).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Maximizing a reward</span>: Determining whether a whistleblower should take (or avoid taking) certain actions that could increase or decrease the size of their future reward and identifying potential “related action” awards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Information and evidence</span>: Determining the information and evidence to include (or exclude) from a submission to the government (e.g., the government does not want information that may violate the company’s attorney-client privilege, such as emails that involve advice from inside or outside counsel).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Whistleblower protections</span>: Determining which laws protect a whistleblower’s particular disclosure (both internal and external) and if the whistleblower suffers retaliation, devising a strategy to maximize their recovery and protect their career.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I could write a short book on this section alone but, in summary, there are endless issues and challenges that whistleblowers face when reporting to the government. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Do you have any advice for people who are considering blowing the whistle?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I strongly suggest that they consult with an experienced attorney <em>before</em> blowing the whistle. At a minimum, a prospective whistleblower should be aware of the federal and state whistleblower reward and protection laws that could potentially apply to their whistleblowing and develop an effective strategy to protect their interests and achieve their objectives. Whistleblowers should get sound advice about the potential risks of stepping forward and make sure that they do not take any actions that could undermine their potential whistleblower reward or retaliation claims — or result in potential liability. Many people are surprised to learn that not all forms of whistleblowing are protected, and certain actions by the whistleblower could expose them to significant civil or even criminal liability (e.g., disclosing a suspicious activity report).  </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is a memorable case or project that you have worked on?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I cannot provide specific details about my cases due to their confidential nature, however, I will say that I have had the privilege of representing many courageous whistleblowers whose information played a critical role in the government’s ability to <a href=""https://www.zuckermanlaw.com/report-ponzi-scheme-earn-sec-whistleblower-award/"">halt large Ponzi schemes</a>, investment scams, tax fraud and significant violations at publicly traded companies. Many of these successful enforcement actions returned significant funds to harmed investors. My proudest moments are when I have the opportunity to tell my clients about the tremendous impact of their whistleblowing and to inform them that they will be receiving a reward.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How do you think the CFE credential has helped your career? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In my experience, most whistleblowers appreciate an attorney who can both navigate the legal process as well as understand and investigate the complex frauds that they are seeking to report. The CFE credential has strengthened my ability to collaborate with clients to perform in-depth investigations to uncover fraud and my legal training enables me to distill the facts into a cogent submission that provides a roadmap for a successful enforcement action. The CFE credential has been especially helpful as I work with the talented attorneys and accountants at the SEC, CFTC and IRS to assist them in investigating fraud schemes, protecting investors and holding fraudsters accountable.</p>

207,"<h1>Member Spotlight: Bernadette Kakooza, CFE</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Bernadette Kakooza, CFE, is more than just an accomplished fraud fighter. As the first female Inspector General for the Detroit Public Schools Community District, she works hard for her geographic community as well as her anti-fraud community. In addition to spearheading investigations to save taxpayer money, she’s an active member of the Southeastern Michigan ACFE chapter and mentors fellow ACFE members.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did you become passionate about fighting fraud?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As a child, I grew up with parents who instilled in me the value of education as well as family values of good manners (before man and God), knowledge (which makes you a complete person) and hard work (which gives you comfort in life). I tapped those personal values to pursue a profession that promotes ethical values in the workplace. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As both a taxpayer and public servant, I wanted to use my passion to promote integrity, accountability and efficiency in our use of the public resources we’re entrusted with. I view my profession as a steward in assisting with improving internal processes and mitigating the opportunities for those who do unethical or fraudulent activities that harm our school district.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">You are the first female to hold the Inspector General designation in Detroit Public Schools Community District. What steps led you to that position?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in political science and possess an MBA from the University of Detroit Mercy with a concentration in business management and accounting. My education prepared me well for my current interests. For more than 20 years, I have served in various capacities within the school district — internal auditor, accountant, senior forensic auditor and fraud investigator. All my prior work experiences grew the enthusiasm within me that has shaped me into the fraud fighter I am today. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I was appointed Inspector General (IG) in March 2014. As a female IG, I realize that we possess the same energy, passion, charisma, drive and commitment as our male counterparts, and have the same ability to drive change within the agencies we serve. Although the IG script may seem to have been written for men in the past, it is time that the glass ceiling is broken down. as Female IGs are now taking up more positions across the local, state and national levels. The city of Detroit currently has a female IG too, with whom I enjoy a great professional relationship. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Detroit Public Schools Community District had a documented history of corruption, lack of accountability and internal control gaps for a while. What were some of the biggest challenges you faced when you came in and implemented new systems and training to combat fraud? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I credit my predecessors, who were both former FBI managers — one being a former Special Agent in Charge, and the other, a Supervisory Special Agent — who stood up the Office of Inspector General within this school District, and established most of the investigative procedures that my team and I use to this day. Of course, there were districtwide challenges at the beginning, but the current superintendent has implemented policies and provided administrative guidelines, which help facilitate our operations. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A few challenges still exist because these policies are not widely communicated to employees. Due to that breakdown in communication, one of the systems I implemented was to expand the scope of my office’s operations to include a proactive compliance training and outreach program, which provides training in ethical conduct and fraud awareness among district employees and school board members. The main problem is that this training is not mandatory, so I keep pushing for more fraud awareness within our district because we must be realistic — fraud exists in <em>every</em> organization, but we can’t tackle the problem unless we’re willing to speak about it. The more training my office can provide to district employees to raise awareness of fraud trends and ethics violations, the more equipped they become to join the OIG in its mission to prevent, detect and deter fraud, waste and abuse within the school system. I am optimistic that the school district leadership recognizes my office’s function as a partner, and not an adversary, in these efforts to maintain an ethical culture within our school district.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What is a memorable case or project that you have worked on?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">One complex case that immediately comes to mind was a successful joint investigation in 2015 that I worked on with the Detroit FBI Public Corruption Unit to develop evidence which led to the arrest and conviction of a district vendor who operated a $2.7 million kickback scheme involving several school district principals. This case attracted nationwide attention and was even featured on CNBC’s show American Greed. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We investigated approximately 15 school principals and a District administrator, who were found to have taken cash gifts from the vendor in exchange for authorizing payments by the district to the vendor. The payments were for school supplies that were ordered from the vendor but were not delivered to the schools. The investigation revealed that the vendor would invoice the district, obtain the principals’ approvals for payment and when he received payment from the district, he’d split the proceeds with the principals. Overall, this investigation (and many others that we’ve conducted) underscored the importance of partnerships and how working together with law enforcement entities — as well as the cooperation we receive from county, state and federal offices — has been very beneficial to our operations.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As the first female in your position, do you have any advice for women in the anti-fraud field? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The anti-fraud field is a tough one, and especially so because fraud itself is constantly evolving and we must keep up with the fraudsters out there. Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or just starting out, there’s always something to learn in the anti-fraud field and everyone must be alert for the fraud trends and red flags. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As a female leader, it is important to not let your gender define you or limit your aspirations in reaching out to do your best — whether working alongside male peers or dealing with male subordinates. There is no one best leadership style, and the “male way” of doing things may differ from the female style, but the two styles are not mutually exclusive. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Now that I have a daughter in college and two others in high school, I am beginning to see that my efforts have amounted to something. And those somethings are living, breathing creatures who don’t stop at anything to pursue what they want in their individual lives; and hopefully, will make great contributions to the world someday. Being female is not even a factor in describing the successes they each inspire aspire to achieve. I am so blessed to have my daughters in my life because they help me understand myself as a working mother. In this intimate journey of self-discovery, I have learned that I can still pursue a career alongside the pace of my children’s lives. So I hope that any young female who is 15-20 years behind me in this profession can be inspired to appreciate the connection between balancing their family lives and pursuing their professional dreams, as I’m sure that those who are a few steps further ahead of me can relate.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How has being a CFE impacted your professional development?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I cherish the opportunities it provides to me for continuing education through the online webinars and annual ACFE conferences with increasingly powerful speakers each year. I view these forums as opportunities for both personal and professional growth, so it’s not just about earning CPE credits, but the wealth of knowledge I gain through participation which improves my skills as a fraud examiner. Having the designation as a Certified Fraud Examiner is a plus too because it shows others that I put a lot of study and specialized training hours into acquiring and maintaining this designation. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What do you like best about being an ACFE member?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I’m most grateful for the professional networking, opportunities to learn more about the anti-fraud industry and interact with other members — especially within our local Southeastern Michigan chapter of the ACFE, where I attend monthly meetings as well as presented on fraud-related topics. I have met and established strong friendships with wonderful individuals through my chapter network; some of whom have contributed a lot to providing me with resources to assist with my work. I’m also grateful to the ACFE which gave me an opportunity to give back as a mentor for other CFEs. Having realized the opportunities this membership presents, I always encourage my subordinates to pursue membership in our local chapter as well as the national ACFE.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What activities or hobbies do you like to do outside of work?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I love to read, bake, go to the movies (which I’ve missed for the last year!) and travel with my kids to visit family overseas.</p>

208,<h1>Applying 5Ws and 1H to Investigative Reports and Presentations</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Mustafa Yusuf-Adebola </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Some months ago, I was hosting a weekly virtual class and talked about the 5Ws and 1H of writing — What, Why, Who, Where, When and How.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I learned this concept from a former boss while working on an investigation and it’s a tool commonly used by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws"">journalists</a> when writing stories, researchers and psychologists when assessing cases. These occupations can be similar to investigators in that they all strive to unearth issues as well as understand the psychology behind an individual’s actions.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>How it applies to investigative reports</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Typically, every investigation revolves around thorough fact finding, which the investigator documents in a report. There may be a pre-approved list of investigations to conduct or unplanned requests may come in as the financial year progresses. The basic core of case management is that there is an allegation or suspicion that needs to be investigated, an investigator uncovers evidence and finally they present their findings in a report to end users. Let’s look at how you can apply the 5Ws and 1H to planning, reporting and presenting your findings in an investigation.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Questions for planning the investigation</strong></h2>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>What</strong> – What is the purpose of this investigation? What is the allegation? What happened? What parties were involved (stakeholders)? What will I need in order to look into the allegation (what resources)? What policies, procedures or laws were potentially breached? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Why</strong> – Why am I looking into this (investigation mandate)? Why did this occur (systemic gaps or opportunities in the Fraud Triangle)? Why did actors in the case do what they did (motive or incentive in the Fraud Triangle)? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Who</strong> – Who is involved? Who should I speak to (for interviewing)? Who am I reporting to? Who is privileged to the investigation? Who is working with me (colleague, working alone, subject matter expert or external provider)? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Where</strong> – Where did the event(s) occur (internal and external locations)? Where did the case emanate from (board-approved list for the year, whistleblower’s portal, external request, etc.)? Where could the case end (internal disciplinary panel, regulator, media interest case or court case)? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>When</strong> – When did the incident(s) occur? When was the allegation made? When is my report due (timeline, notes for mandates)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>How</strong> – How will I conduct the investigation (methodology, procedures and investigative plan)? How will evidence be preserved? How will I present my findings once I’ve documented them in writing (through speech narration, presentation or written)? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Questions to answer in your report of the investigation</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">After you complete the fieldwork and evidence gathering, you need to draft the report .Here are more considerations the 5Ws and 1H bring:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What was the outcome of the investigation? What allegations seem to be correct based on your findings? What were the limitations of the investigation? What are the implications for the company?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Why did the fraud occur? Why were the perpetrators motivated to do it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Who is the report addressed to (liability clause)? Who was directly involved in the fraud? Who may have allowed the fraud to occur, but did not have direct ties to it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Where did the event(s) occur? (You may include a map of the locations in your report).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When did the fraud occur? (You should include an estimated start date along with an end date, or an explanation that the fraud is still occurring).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did the fraud occur? How much did it cost the company? How much could the company potentially pay in fines if found to be flouting regulations? How should the report be distributed? How many people were involved in the fraud? How can the fraud be mitigated in the future?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Presentation of findings</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While your written report should have answered the important questions already, it is still important to have the 5Ws and 1H in mind before presenting your findings and report. The skill of storytelling helps because the recipient of the report, counsel or judge could potentially ask questions in different forms or phrases than the way you presented the findings in your written report. People are curious and will ask questions, so before they ask, you can anticipate the potential questions using the 5Ws and 1H to have the answers ready beforehand. As a popular Cameroonian proverb goes, “he who asks questions cannot avoid the answer.”</p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Takara Small hosts this in-depth analysis into the mysterious death of Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old CEO of Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Cotten’s death — said to have occurred under unusual circumstances while honeymooning in India in 2018 — precipitated the disappearance of nearly $250 million and the proliferation of conspiracy theories trying to make sense of his mysterious past. Good news for curious ACFE listeners: Takara Small will be speaking at the 2021 <a href=""https://www.fraudconference.com/canada2021.aspx"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><em>Fraud Conference Canada</em></a>, as well as at the 2022 <em>Women’s Summit</em>!</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>2. Scam Goddess</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Comedian Laci Mosley investigates the hottest scams in current events alongside a different guest each week.

<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>4. Chameleon: High Rollers</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Set in Las Vegas, “Chameleon: High Rollers” tells the tale of a two-year-long FBI sting that completely failed, ending with no convictions. Through host Trevor Aaronson’s investigations, the podcast traces this nebulous history in which every character’s true identity is far from who or what they claim to be.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>5. The Dream</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In “The Dream,” hosts Jane Marie and Dann Gallucci attempt to do the unthinkable: expose the farces at the core of some of the largest industries today. In season one, they dive into multilevel marketing (MLM), a business strategy that more often than not enters into the territory of a pyramid scheme. The recently released season two takes on the $4 trillion wellness industry, debunking pseudoscience scams that have millions of people hooked all over the world.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>6. The Perfect Scam</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Produced by the AARP, “The Perfect Scam’s” mission is fraud prevention, through and through.

<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>7. American Greed</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">“American Greed” exposes the twisted tales of what happens when the American Dream gets tainted by ulterior motives. In each episode, host Stacy Keach presents tales of lies and deceit told by people seeking fame and fortune, without any mind to the potential consequences.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>8. The Dropout</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While Elizabeth Holmes is practically a household name now, “The Dropout” tactfully avoids all the mythologizing that has gone into the history of the sham company Theranos. The podcast clearly presents the facts and illogic that led to one of the most talked-about scams within recent history.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>9. Bed of Lies</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What happens when law enforcement officers are encouraged to engage in one of the largest fraud scandals in England’s history? Produced by The Telegraph, “Bed of Lies” explores a gripping and devastating tale of identity theft perpetrated by the British government’s use of “spy cops” who took their assignments to inhumane degrees.</p>

210,<h1>Top 5 Fraud-Related Movies</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Cindy Greenman, CFE</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">For me, one thing that came about during the pandemic is that my husband and I love watching movies together. We both have our favorite genres. He prefers the shoot-’em-up action thrillers. I enjoy comedies and dramas. But I especially enjoy a movie that involves parts of my career in the anti-fraud profession.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Hollywood is no stranger to glamorizing the world of fraud. There are many films and television shows out there that cover this topic, and often they are criticized for their portrayal and romanticizing of crimes. Some critics have suggested that these types of portrayals have led to copycat criminals. There is even a film festival in New Zealand focused solely on fraud. The NZ International Fraud Film Festival only includes movies based on scams, forgery, tax evasion and corruption. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Recently, on an <a href=""https://connect.acfe.com/home"">ACFE Community</a> discussion post, a question was posed: What is your favorite fraud movie? </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Well, here are the results of that post, as well as me posing this same question on the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/groups/66889/"">ACFE LinkedIn group</a>. I list these in no particular order, only that they are the top five mentioned in both surveys*. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>All the Queen’s Horses (2017)</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This documentary was the project of professor Kelly Richmond-Pope. She recounts the story of Rita Crundwell who managed to embezzle more than $53 million from her small hometown while working as the city clerk for over 20 years.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As a professor myself, I assign this documentary to all of my auditing students as well as my forensic accounting students. Some of the main lessons from this documentary are that 1) people see what they want to see, until it is right in front of them and they can no longer deny the truth, 2) smaller organizations are often the most at risk, and 3) the “we’re all family” type atmosphere makes it more difficult to distrust or question our coworkers.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Catch Me If You Can (2002)</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Even though the movie is nearly 20 years old, it’s still one of the top-rated movies on financial fraud based on the true yet hard-to-believe story of Frank Abagnale. Even before Abagnale turned 19 years old, he was worth millions of dollars. Eventually, he poses as a pilot of a major airline, a surgical doctor, a prosecuting attorney and other professionals without a high school education. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This movie demonstrates that age is meaningless. Abagnale started his crimes at 16, stealing his father’s credit card. It wasn’t until many years later that he was convicted of cashing over $2.5 million in bad checks. The movie illustrates how confidence is truly the key. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>The Accountant (2016)</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In the movie, the accountant is much more than a number cruncher. He has Asperger’s syndrome, which is on Autism spectrum, and the film portrays him using his disability to quickly decipher the books for crime bosses. The movie has many twists and turns and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. It is an action thriller with an accounting backdrop.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Lessons we can learn from this movie are:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There’s more than meets the eye. Auditing is more than a desk job. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Do your due diligence when selecting clients and be prepared for anything.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Accounting can be fun and exciting!</li>
</ol>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>The Wolf of Wall Street</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This film is based on the true-life story of Jordan Belfort, a financial broker who became enormously wealthy by committing fraud and stock market manipulation. The movie portrays the extravagant lifestyle of Belfort as he drinks, drugs and sexes his way through his early 20s, giving the SEC and FBI ample opportunity to investigate. A little-known fact: Belfort went to federal prison for 22 months where one of his “cube-mates” was Tommy Chong (comedian, actor, activist). It was Chong who convinced Belfort to write his life story, which eventually served as inspiration for the film.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As CFEs, we all know doing our own research is best. This movie gives us good reason to keep believing that is true. Their use of a “boiler room” and aggressive sales tactics shows that everyone should complete their own research and ignore the hype. It also tells us, as investigators, to watch out for those aggressive, cocky wheelers and dealers. In fact, one of the six most common behavioral red flags of fraud, according to the ACFE’s Report to the Nations, is a general “wheeler-dealer” attitude.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Wizard of Lies (2017)</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Like many of the films on this list, this one is also based on real-life events. The drama is based on the life and crimes of the late Bernie Madoff, who founded his own company on Wall Street in the 1960s. Over many years his company turned into one of the largest investment funds in the world. His arrest in 2008 revealed the truth behind his multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, the largest in history.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The investigator in all of us, as CFEs, should learn a few things from this particular piece of history. </p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Never give up on a hunch. There were a few people who knew something was not right with Madoff’s numbers and kept at it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Sometimes we have to swallow our pride. If it doesn’t make sense to you, it might not make sense to others either. Swallow our pride and ask others to explain it to us. Madoff used complicated quantitative analytics to keep investigators from getting too close. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>*The survey results are not scientific in any way. </em></p>

211,<h1>A Stolen Text Messages Hack That Only Costs $16</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Hallie Ayres </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A recent <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">investigation by VICE</a> found a major loophole in telecommunications infrastructure. Joseph Cox, the investigative reporter at the center of the story enlisted the help of a friendly hacker to report on a service called Sakari, a company that streamlines mass SMS messaging for businesses. The hacker was able to use the service to reroute all of Cox’s text messages to the hacker’s device, and Cox didn’t receive a single notification about the theft of his number. He just stopped receiving text messages.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Sakari offers their SMS marketing services for $16, which is their cheapest plan. It requires the client to add a phone number associated with the account. This number is then used to send and receive text messages, even if that phone number doesn’t actually belong to the company. Sakari does mandate that users sign a Letter of Authorization (LOA) that requires the user to agree that they won’t “conduct any unlawful, harassing, or inappropriate behavior with the text messaging service and phone number,” but Sakari does not send any sort of message to the number in question to confirm this consent.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The hacker explained their process as follows: “I used a prepaid card to buy [Sakari’s] $16 per month plan and then after that was done it let me steal numbers just by filling out the LOA with fake info.” The use of prepaid cards makes the perpetrators of these hacks even more difficult to track down.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Once the hacker gains access to all the messages being received to a certain number, they can easily find their way into accounts like WhatsApp and Postmates, where the authorization for access depends only on a phone number or a code sent to that number.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>A new hacking frontier</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This hack differs from the more common SIM jacking because unlike SIM jacking, from the perspective of the person whose phone number was just stolen, their phone appears completely normal. Another aspect of this hack is that the specific carrier for a phone number is irrelevant. The ease with which this hack can be successfully executed exposes major flaws in telecommunications infrastructure and a lack of regulations around commercial SMS services.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">After Cox reached out to Sakari, the company implemented a security feature where the newly subscribed phone number receives an automated call and has to report back to Sakari with a security code in order for their account to be fully activated. However, Sakari is only one example of this type of SMS tool. According to one of Cox’s sources, it took only two minutes to find another service that would allow the hack after getting cut off from a different provider.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In a statement given to VICE, Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at <a href=""https://www.eff.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, an internet civil liberties organization, says that this type of hack “underscores the importance of moving people ... off of ‘login with your phone number’ solutions.”</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Policy changes as a result</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In a March 25 <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dp7ad/tmobile-verizon-att-sms-hijack-change"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">response</a> to Cox’s exposé, the communications company Aerialink, which routes text messages, stated, “Wireless carriers will no longer be supporting SMS or MMS text enabling on their respective numbers.” The new <a href=""http://docs.aerialink.net/compliance/10dlc-toll-free-a2p/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">protocol</a> is “industry-wide” and “affects all SMS providers in the mobile ecosystem.”</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Not only does this change affect all major carriers, but it will also change the entire future of companies like Sakari that depend on enabling text messages to run the services they offer.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">While it’s common for the telecommunications industry to face investigations into ways it may be misusing user data, it’s less likely that these services face interrogation into ways they could be abused by hackers and fraudsters. Cox’s article exposes a vital flaw in these regulations, but it also highlights the meaningful changes that can come about as a result of thoughtful anti-fraud investigation.</p>

212,<h1>Common Money Laundering Risks With Third-Party Payments</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By Lin Danwan, CFE</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">E-payment through third-party channels or platforms — like Venmo, Cash App, Alipay or WeChat Pay — is widely used in our daily life, especially as COVID-19 spread and stay-at-home restrictions fueled precipitous growth of third-party payments. To clarify, I’m not referring to mobile banking apps or payment apps operated by the banks. Let’s focus on apps that function independently yet connect consumers, merchants and banks to mold a payment loop. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Such payment methods bring convenience to individual consumers, making transactions more efficient and flexible. Yet, this model lowers the cost and time to commit crimes and also intensifies fund-flow channels. The associated money laundering risks should not be overlooked. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To understand these risks, let’s take a look at the third-party payment flow and bring out the iterated anti-money laundering (AML) measures as well as the major difficulties to implement them.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Third-party payment flow</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Payment processes usually involve five functions: </p>
<ol>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Platform telecommunication service</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Customer interface</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Transaction processing</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Account provision</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Settlement </li>
</ol>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As an example, let’s take a closer look at a third-party payment transaction process. The chart below illustrates the general funds flow of a payment model:</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><img alt=""5 steps of third-party payment flow and transaction process."" src=""https://www.acfe.com/-/media/images/shared/acfe-insights/resized-acfe-insights-images/third-party-payments-funds-flowchart-(1).png?h=474&amp;w=726&amp;hash=966797A221C102CDC845A6BF78F6DE55"" style=""height: 474px; width: 726px; left: 647.431px; top: 821.042px;""/></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As indicated, an independent third party is involved in the payment loop. It nearly assumes the function of settlement, particularly when the third-party processor establishes a deposit relationship with a financial institution to process payments for its users. Third parties’ deposit account becomes a de facto internal account that financial institutions cannot clearly dissect.<br/>
Think about it this way. The whole payment process is divided into separate areas: </p>
<ol>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Payment instructions are retained by third parties.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Financial institutions do not “see” the details of the transactions, only deposits to and withdrawals from the third-party payment service.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Financial institutions have no knowledge of the individuals or the sellers.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Characteristics and risks</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Generally, we may find these common difficulties when attempting to manage AML risks associated with third-party payment vendors:</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">ANONYMITY</h3>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Customer identity is obfuscated. A perpetrator may be allowed to access these types of payment services, without disclosing their identity to the third party. Or they use a false name to circumvent the KYC screening. It’s even possible that multiple accounts may be controlled by one perpetrator through one third-party platform. In this logic, suspicious names cannot be effectively detected. </li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It makes cashing out easier. Transaction parties’ identities are not always known when the transactions initially take place, and those bank account names are not unveiled until settlement is fully completed, which provides a convenient time gap for perpetrators to take advantage of.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fund source and beneficiary are disguised. Given that the payment loop is segregated, and that relevant data is separately preserved by different interested parties, perpetrators can take advantage of this segregation model so as to disguise the origin and destination of the funds.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Transaction due diligence and authenticity is more difficult. Transaction counterparties are rarely accurately recorded, so AML officers encounter more challenges when profiling customers and depicting transaction patterns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">RAPIDITY</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Traditional fund transfer is required to go through specific sets of operative steps, which to a certain extent, lowers the fund movement. Third-party payments economize those operations, which means funds are instantly debited and credited, shortening the cycle to perform one criminal transaction. On the other hand, quick fund movement leaves little time to effectively intercept suspicious transactions.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">EVASIVENESS</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Perpetrators tend to intensively repeat fund transferals, complicating the fund flows, and consequently break the fund trails. Such smurfing also frustrates the transaction monitoring system, hiding suspicious activities beneath massive scale of data.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">INEFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Over the past few years, money laundering through third-party payment vendors has become more synergic, specialized and standardized, involving different action groups and multiple jurisdictions. Also note that that payment models vary from business to business and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Risk control measures also produce varying degrees of effectiveness. In one jurisdiction, reconciling between the regulatory standard, regulated parties’ control effectiveness and customers’ operational convenience is far from easy.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Recommended actions and difficulties</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Regulators are encouraging market participants to take innovative approaches for financial inclusion. To establish a proportionate but not burdensome regulation is crucial. Regulatory guidance and practitioners’ controls can also evolve to better accommodate between the development opportunities and risks. The most imminent and necessary actions rest primarily through the below aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Identification of customers and customer profiling, including but not limited to KYC tailored to third-party payment processors.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Licensing and responsibilities of third-party payment processors.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Operating guidelines, transaction amount limits and internal controls.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Enhanced record-keeping by third-party payment vendors.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">More robust transaction monitoring and suspicious transaction reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">These AML procedures should be scrupulously carried out throughout the entire transaction process. Currently, when it comes to mitigating money laundering risks, we usually find ambiguity in the terms of service by third-party payment processors, or AML and KYC are not mentioned at all. That is because the delineation of responsibilities varies among payment systems and jurisdictions. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">However, in the payment loop, the party who manages the account records should undertake AML responsibilities, especially as the information of funds movement heaps up. If third-party payment vendors adapt this mentality, it could hopefully lead to comprehensive monitoring and analysis.</p>

213,"<h1>ACFE Voices: Charles Washington, CFE</h1>","<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Charles Washington, CFE, is a senior director, global fraud and asset protection at Pfizer. He is responsible for external fraud prevention, investigation and recovery strategies. He developed one of the first global programs in the pharmaceutical industry dedicated to anti-fraud initiatives. He is known for his expertise in product diversion fraud and is a leader in developing collaborative relationships between drug manufacturers and health practitioners to mitigate pharmaceutical fraud risks. Washington frequently speaks at conferences and trains others on pharmaceutical frauds and diversion schemes.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Recently, Washington spoke on a panel for an ACFE webinar titled “A Conversation About Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Anti-Fraud Profession.” In this post, he digs in even further into this topic to share insights and advice on how you can make an impact in your own workplace and foster a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion as an anti-fraud professional. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did your understanding of diversity, equity and inclusion take shape, particularly in your professional life?<strong></strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Navigating diversity and inclusion became a part of my life well before I began my professional career. We live in a world where prejudice, bias and unfair treatment has become part of the fabric of our society. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) has become an important part of professionalism and career development that is designed to eliminate bias and unfair practices in the workplace. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Unfair practices due to race, sex and religion were relatively common as I was growing up, so I had to set higher standards for myself and endured to exceed those standards, to ensure I could compete. I prepared myself to be ready for opportunities that came into my path. I never expected DEI programs to provide any special advantages, but these programs were helpful in exposing greater opportunities on a fair playing field. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">DEI programs, although well-intended, were not always successful, but they created a platform for me to challenge unfair practices. This made me feel like I was not fighting alone. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What skills do you have as an anti-fraud professional that help you support diversity, equity and inclusion?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I don’t have any special skills, anti-fraud or otherwise, that helped me to support diversity. I  support DEI because it’s the right thing to do as a diverse and inclusive environment creates a more productive workplace. DEI programs have been meaningful as a remedy for addressing bias in the workplace. My career as a fraud examiner has made me quite efficient at lie detection.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When you examine bias carefully, you will see that bias behavior is built on the foundation of a lie. I believe that human bias, unconscious or otherwise, is one of the greatest frauds inflicted upon our society. As a fraud examiner, I have unraveled a myriad of schemes promulgated by lies that were so well told, they resemble the truth. People who exhibit bias behaviors and unfair practices are like fraudsters; initially they believe there is some form of righteousness in their behavior. So, I go back to my original premise: DEI programs play an important role in ensuring fairness, but more work must be done to eradicate bias — “the lie.”    </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What are some unique challenges in the anti-fraud profession related to diversity, equity and inclusion? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This is a difficult question to answer even though I have been in the midst of this question for most of my career. The anti-fraud profession is a unique profession in that it is not within the mainstream of occupations sought out by most people. A large segment of the profession is made up of independent entities addressing fraud in unique ways. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Even when anti-fraud is a platform service in larger companies, the number of anti-fraud colleagues are usually minimal. The independence and unique skill set of the anti-fraud profession requires a higher level of sensitivity to diversity and inclusion. To address these challenges, anti-fraud businesses and organization at all levels should implement diversity programs and include an anti-bias statement in their ethics or code of conduct. The support for diversity can easily be overlooked if anti-fraud professionals do not take overt actions to recognize the possibility of unfairness and have protocols in place for prevention.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How do you advocate for these values in your own workplace?</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">These values are active in my workplace; however, I play a role to make them effective by promoting trust among the colleagues I work with, challenging unfairness wherever I see it and ensuring that my own hiring practices are equitable. As I indicated earlier, diversity is a remedy to limit the results of bias and inequity. The latter may always exist; therefore, DEI must be judicious. It must be well thought out to include a path for every level of the organization. Lower echelon employees seem to have less access to DEI programs.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What advice do you have for others in the anti-fraud profession who want to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Thank you for this question. This will be the easiest one to answer, but maybe the hardest for many to implement: Show respect to everyone; always be fair, even at your own peril; and do something to help someone else. </p>

214,<h1>7 Warning Signs That May Indicate Fraud Within Your Company</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Rebecca Dunne</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In organizations, some common types of fraud are unauthorized use of physical and monetary company assets and the misrepresentation of financial statements to make organizations appear more economically successful than what they actually are.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">According to the ACFE’s <a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2020/"">2020 <em>Report to the Nations</em></a>, organizations with less than 100 employees suffered larger median losses than those of larger companies. In other words, fraud can happen at any organization, no matter the size, so it’s important to understand the warning signs.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">So, what are the warning signs to look out for?</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>1. Suspicious financials</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">When budgets are not being met (either being under met, or over met) and financials are not being delivered as timely as they should be, this could indicate a more serious issue. Some questions to ask are:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Are there any unusual cash transactions? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Are there mismatched payees? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Does the payee’s name match the name in the general accounting book? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Have there been identical payments cleared to different vendors in the same date range? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Do the suppliers of vendors being paid have unprofessional invoices? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Are the vendors known as questionable companies? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Unfortunately, it can be a warning sign when things look too good to be true. If sales are way above the norm, or if revenues exceed expectations, there may be a case of some dodgy accounting behind the scenes. If businesses have more than one bank account, there may be inappropriate cash movements. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What to do:</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Have regular audits for the accounts and teams.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>2. Out-of-character emails</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If you receive an unusual email, or one which fails to comply to the organization’s usual practices, it could indicate that a scam is underway. Worse, it could signal that an employee’s email account has already been compromised. According to the ACFE’s <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/covidreport.aspx""><em>Fraud in the Wake of COVID-19: Benchmarking Report, September Edition</em></a>, 83% of anti-fraud professionals who were surveyed have observed an increase in cyberfraud since the pandemic began. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What to do:</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Increase cybersecurity training for employees, specifically focusing on how to recognize phishing attempts and how to comply with the organization’s work-from-home cyber policies.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>3. Staff are resisting tighter controls</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If staff are resistant to new internal control systems, this could be a sign that they are hiding something and do not want to be caught. Of course, there are normal resistances such as not liking change or not wanting additional work to do or processes to follow. However, there may also be something deeper.  </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What to do: </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Schedule a meeting and have a one-on-one conversation with any employee who has difficulty with the new controls. Figure out where the resistance is coming from and address the issue from that vantage point.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>4. Overly close relationships within the business</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">High-risk employees are those who have trusted roles in finance or purchasing. These individuals have more access to company assets, which means they have more opportunity to commit fraud. If there are close relationships among a group of such people, or even among one high-risk individual and a small group of others, it can be a sign of fraud.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In kickback scenarios, employees from the company may also have a relationship with a vendor who overcharges the company. As the vendor gets more cash from the company, the insider may earn a return since the two split the difference.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What to do:  </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Monitor relations between employees. If it appears people are unusually friendly, talk with them and remind them about the importance of being professional and treating everyone equally, and not having favorites.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>5. Travel reimbursement irregularities</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This area is relatively simple to abuse. If there is little attention paid to such expenses, employees can falsify their expense records. For example, an employee could easily add on a few extra company lunches each month. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What to do: </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Ensure your organization has internal controls in place to monitor all expenses and verify they are legitimate.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>6. Unusual employee circumstances</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Sometimes an employee will need to work late, or they will need to change up their schedule to accommodate an unexpected life event. Of course, throughout the current pandemic, there have been many unusual circumstances that have upended everyone’s day-to-day routine. However, if an unusual pattern emerges, that is worth a closer look. Here are some behaviors to pay attention to:</p>
<ul data-rte-list=""default"">
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An employee frequently asks to work extra hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An employee frequently asks to work outside of regular business hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An employee refuses to share certain tasks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An employee will only work with a certain supplier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What to do: </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Ensure employees can justify their unusual circumstances. When such requests are made, be sure to follow up. If they want to work late to finish a report, be sure that the report is actually finished. Similarly, security cameras could be used, as well as close audits.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>7. Expensive purchases</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If an employee purchases something expensive, be it a new car, house or a holiday, consider if the purchase aligns with their salary. Does it add up that this has been purchased? As always, there are legitimate circumstances that can explain big purchases — the employee has been saving for it, they just received some winnings or even an inheritance from a loved ones’ will. But, generally, if a pattern of large purchases emerges, this can be a moment to question if their salary justifies the purchases.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What to do: </h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Assess if there are other potential warning signs, such as the ones included above. If there are, this may be enough to dig deeper. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">If you face any of these warning signs, it is important to take a closer look. If necessary, your organization may need to investigate these situations further because, as we all know, fraud can have a hefty effect on any organization.</p>

215,<h1>Prevent Fraud Before It Happens: How to Train Employees to Be Fraud Detectors</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Michele L. Creek-Tatom, CFE, CIA</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>“That could never happen here! Why would someone ever steal from our company? The internal audit people will catch it if someone tries anything. My co-workers are like family! I just can’t imagine someone doing that!”</em></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Does this sound familiar? As anti-fraud professionals, we are trained to find and fix the opportunities for fraudulent activity within our organizations. But there are usually only a few of us and many employees. How is a small team, or single fraud professional, supposed to deter and detect all fraud? The answer is we can’t. We rely, in part, on the honesty of the average employee. For dishonest employees, we rely on controls and consequences to deter bad behavior. But what if there were a way to enlist and educate the honest, frontline employee to be the eyes and ears of everyday fraud detection? What if fraud awareness became every employee’s responsibility — not just the fraud professionals’? </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The ACFE’s 2020 <em>Report to the Nations</em> found that 43% of fraud cases are identified through tips, and just 50% of those tips come from employees. These employees work in the business, follow processes, and possibly work side-by-side with potential fraudsters, so why is this number so low? Fellow employees should recognize anomalies and irregularities first, but how do they know what to look for? What if they don’t understand the risk of fraud in a process so they can’t watch for wrongdoings? There is a tremendous opportunity to harness the collective power of the workforce by increasing fraud awareness and training each employee to be a fraud detector. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Fraud risk in daily operations </strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Several years ago, I was talking with an employee who worked in our cash application department (I’ll call her Sally). At the time, customers liked to come into a location and pay their invoice in person. The location would mail the checks to the cash application department at headquarters for posting and depositing. Sally was a longtime employee who valued the in-person nature of our business and was happy to take the checks received in her department to the bank for deposit. What Sally didn’t understand was the risk of check fraud involved in that scenario, and because she didn’t understand that she didn’t know where the process had vulnerabilities. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Through our conversation, I outlined all the different hands the check traveled through — a minimum of six pairs — before the check was safely deposited into the bank account and the funds received. I described the various points at which the check could be lost, or stolen, and deposited into someone else’s account. Sally refuted my description, saying the check was safe because it was written to the company. That is when the discussion turned to all the ways checks are altered and deposited into accounts that don’t belong to the intended recipient. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Sally was floored! She had no idea that checks written to specific companies could be deposited or presented for payment elsewhere. Because this was not a possibility to her, she had no way to ensure appropriate controls were in place and had no perspective about the risk involved in her current process. While all checks now go directly to a lock box, the conversation highlighted something important — fraudulent activity can be right in front of us, and if we are untrained, we can’t see it for what it is. Additionally, those who understand fraud might not know where the risks lie or what controls should be in place. If they don’t know what they don’t know, how can we rely on our employees for tips? </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This is where we, as fraud professionals, come in. We must teach our fellow employees where the company is vulnerable, and help them understand what activities, behaviors and transactions might be questionable. We must provide safe, confidential methods for employees to report fraud or questionable activity. We must ensure employees know how and where to report these activities. But where do we start? </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Components of effective fraud awareness trainings</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A comprehensive fraud awareness training should include basic information to help your employees identify when something isn’t right. That basic information is the what/how, the who, and the why people commit fraud. Also consider relevant case studies, graphics that tell the story, and the effect fraud has on the employee directly and the organization. Include details on when, how and who to report to if an employee sees something questionable.  </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What and How</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Provide enough detail about the kinds of frauds employees could see at the company, including examples that tie directly back to the employee’s work. Rather than stating they might be vulnerable to vendor fraud, help employees understand exactly what vendor fraud looks like. Make sure they know what they can do in their daily job to prevent it. We help employees see that checking inventory deliveries against a packing slip or bill-of-lading, as well as against the purchase order, helps prevent a vendor from sending subpar or a shortage of inventory, and/or at a price different than agreed upon. This discussion helps employees see that what they thought might be mundane tasks have a purpose that protects the company, and ultimately their livelihoods. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As you describe the what and how, don’t rely too heavily on “fraud speak.” The goal is to help employees understand categories of fraud and provide examples of what those categories can mean. It’s important to use relatable language that connects with employees in a way that is engaging and encourages participation. Specific examples help employees connect the theoretical idea of fraud, to the realization, “Wow, this can actually happen (or has happened) at my workplace.” </p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Who</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Create the profile of a common fraudster and use statistics and any relevant information to bring your profile to life. Effective types of information include gender (global and regional counts), average age, position in the company, the department in which the employee worked, median dollar loss, and education level. Using data from the ACFE’s <em>Report to the Nations</em>, highlight the “never charged or convicted” and “never punished or terminated” numbers to illustrate that most fraudsters don’t start out as hardened criminals. We hear from employees that they cannot believe the person in the cube next to them could possibly commit fraud because, “They don’t look or act like a criminal.” In order to break these biases, provide data-supported information in your training to speak to the fact that it really can be, and often is, the person you least expect.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Why</h3>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Understanding why a person would resort to committing fraud is critical in opening employees’ minds to the possibility of it occurring. Without acceptance of a fraudster’s reasonings, recognition of the activity as fraudulent is nearly impossible. Why would a normally good, honest, hardworking person do such a thing? What could cause them to change their behavior? Enter the Fraud Triangle. Fraud professionals are aware of the Fraud Triangle, but are your employees? And even if they are, would they understand what is meant by “opportunity, pressure and rationalization?”  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To demonstrate why, we created a graphic that breaks down the three legs of the <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/fraud-resources/fraud-101-what-is-fraud"">Fraud Triangle</a>. When people hear <em>opportunity</em>, they might not think about lack of monitoring, weak controls or lack of discipline for offenders. They might not realize that <em>rationalization</em> can start out as innocently as, “I am just borrowing it for a brief period and plan to pay it back right away.” They also might not understand that sales targets or a newly developed gambling addiction can send someone right over the edge with <em>pressure</em>. Displaying these items in the training has helped our employees grasp the theory and start to develop awareness. </p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Monica Modi Dalwadi, CFE, CPA, is a managing partner in the D.C. area for Baker Tilly. She works primarily with owners and financial officers of companies, providing business consulting services. She also acts as a valued advisor to her clients as a partner and leader in risk, internal audit and cybersecurity. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Recently, Dalwadi spoke on a panel for an ACFE webinar titled “A Conversation About Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Anti-Fraud Profession.” With Baker Tilly, she serves on the firm's National Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Steering Committee, the Core Strategy Committee and the D.C. Growth and Retention of Women Committee. Needless to say, she’s devoted a lot of time, care and energy into fostering a culture of belonging.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">And now, Dalwadi has generously shared even more tips, advice and insight into how anti-fraud professionals can work to create a similar environment in their workplace, their community and beyond. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How did your understanding of diversity, equity and inclusion take shape, particularly in your professional life? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I started my career traveling around rural North Carolina. At that time, there weren’t many women or individuals of color in C-level roles for my clients or in partner roles for my prior firm. I realized that I wanted role models who could help me navigate my career, family and life aspirations. Once I moved back to the D.C. metro region, I joined a firm (Baker Tilly) that had a powerful women’s initiative. As they evolved the program to add initiatives for people of color and younger professionals, I witnessed the impact that a concerted effort could have on the culture and outcomes of a firm. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What skills do you have as an anti-fraud professional that help you support diversity, equity and inclusion?  </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">My ability to put together an in-depth work program and then test it continuously for flaws or issues has helped in DEI efforts. I developed our first playbook for our SOAR (Supporting Opportunity and Advancement and Recognition) program. The SOAR team and I would measure our work and progress on an ongoing basis. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What are some unique challenges in the anti-fraud profession related to diversity, equity and inclusion? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Many individuals might get their start in the industry in public accounting, audit or finance. These professions aren’t ones that are traditionally sought after by individuals of color at the college level. When you have a career that hasn’t been properly sold to the full population, it makes it tough to develop senior talent that has the diversity we all strive to achieve. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">How do you advocate for these values in your own workplace? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As the managing partner of the D.C. office, I oversee our diversity, inclusion and belonging efforts. I champion “success plans” for people of color and women who aspire to partner levels. I participate in strategy setting and execution of our efforts daily.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">What advice do you have for others in the anti-fraud profession who want to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment? </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">This is a marathon, not a sprint. Pick one to three actions annually, use your data to see if you’re making progress, and push those goals hard. If you do that consistently over many years, you will see progress. </p>

<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In this episode of <em>Fraud Talk</em>, Mason Wilder, CFE, ACFE senior research specialist, and Brian Fox, vice president of strategic partnerships at Thomson Reuters and president &amp; founder of Confirmation, discuss the rise and fall of the German payments group, Wirecard.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Below is an excerpt from the full transcript, where Wilder and Fox discuss the impact of financial statement fraud and how some of the recent schemes like Wirecard affect more than just the bottom line. </p>
<span class=""button primary with-arrow"" style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/behind-the-scenes-of-wirecards-billion-dollar/id1046969130?i=1000489338710"">Listen to the full episode.</a></span>
<p><strong>Mason</strong>: <span style=""white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Have you run into situations that are similar to this in terms of some of those cash assets stashed in foreign jurisdictions? And if so, how have you handled the challenges associated with confirming those account balances?</span></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Brian: </strong>Great question. Confirmation fraud really dates back a hundred years at this point. The very first confirmation fraud documented was McKesson &amp; Robbins way back in the 1920s and '30s. That same fraud technique where you inflate revenue and have the offsetting journal entry to cash receivables then therefore circumvent the auditor's confirmation procedures, is the same fraud that we see, unfortunately, that I've seen over and over and over again. As I mentioned, HealthSouth, while it had a couple, I think $2.5 billion of fraud, $400 million was fake revenue, and therefore $400 million of fake cash.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We've seen it really in certain fraud. Anytime you see a company where they have inflated revenue, because the offsetting journal entries should go to either cash or receivables, typically in those inflated revenue scenarios or where cash is missing, significant material amounts of cash are missing, the way the company got away with that was by circumventing the auditor's confirmation procedures.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We've seen that here in the United States with the Peregrine Financial Group fraud, where the CEO of that business stole $200 million over a 20-year period. The big one now that we're talking about obviously is Wirecard with $2 billion in missing cash, but the Parmalat fraud, they had $4.9 billion of fake cash. In the Olympus fraud, which was in — Parmalat was Europe's largest fraud ever. Olympus was Japan's largest fraud ever. It was a confirmation fraud. Satyam was India's largest fraud ever. Again, another receivable confirmation fraud, but circumvented the auditor's confirmation procedures there. About half the reverse Chinese merger frauds in 2009 dealt with inflated revenue and phony confirmation procedures.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">We continue to see it over and over. More recently, we've seen Luckin Coffee, which inflated a third of their revenue, over $300 million of fake revenue. You look at NMC Health, which is a Middle Eastern company, and TAL Education, another Chinese company. The facts are all still coming out for some of the more recent ones, but it appears it at the forefront at this point that inflating revenue by circumventing the auditor's confirmation procedures are really what the technique was used to commit fraud in each of these cases.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Mason: </strong>Right. You talk about these massive frauds with these huge losses. This does kind of fit in with the data that we get consistently on our <em>Report to the Nations</em> that we put out every two years and that survey, we have financial statement fraud as the most expensive average loss by far, well above corruption and asset misappropriation. In our most recent 2020 <em>Report to the Nations</em>, based on our survey results, the average loss in financial statement fraud was just under a million dollars. When you're talking about company balance sheets and everything, these schemes, the losses tend to get a lot bigger than just your average fare of frauds.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Brian: </strong>Then really what ends up happening, certainly with the public company frauds, and even with a lot of the private company frauds, where we have private investors or lenders. What ends up happening is they're the ones that really take the biggest hit. In the case of Wirecard, what we've seen is an estimate of over $20 billion in total investment and loan losses because of the $2 billion of fake revenue and fake cash. The company has gone into insolvency, which is Germany's version of bankruptcy. The stock typically tanks, the investors lose billions of dollars of money lent. Sometimes they get pennies on the dollar back. The true financial damage, even beyond the specific fraud amount that was manipulated, are the investor in debt losses that everybody else ends up incurring because of that fraud.</p>

218,<h1>Top 4 Internal Controls That Reduce Fraud Losses</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: ACFE Staff</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Proactive anti-fraud controls play a key role in an organization’s fight against fraud. While the presence of these mechanisms alone does not ensure that all fraud will be prevented, management’s commitment to and investment in targeted prevention and detection measures send a clear message to employees, vendors, customers and others about the organization’s anti-fraud stance. But what happens when controls are not present? What happens when budget cuts and shifting roles mean that some controls are overlooked or take a back seat to revenue and survival?</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The ACFE’s <a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2020/"">2020 <em>Report to the Nations</em></a> not only identifies the top anti-fraud controls that can help protect organizations, but also illustrates what can happen when controls are weak or altogether missing.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">To help organizations understand the potential impact of various controls, we compared the median losses and median durations of the frauds in our study based on whether each specific control was present at the victim organization during the fraud’s occurrence. For every control examined, organizations that had the control in place experienced smaller fraud losses and detected frauds more quickly than organizations lacking that control.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Below are the top four internal controls that reduce fraud losses and can improve detection:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A robust code of conduct.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A strong internal audit department.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Management certifications of financial statements.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Management reviews of internal controls, processes, accounts or transactions.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">These four anti-fraud controls were associated with a 50% or greater reduction in both fraud losses and fraud duration. Internal audits and management reviews are both mechanisms that can be used to actively look for fraud, so their correlation with reduced fraud losses and duration stands to reason. In contrast, codes of conduct and management certifications of financial statements are less directly tied to fraud detection, but both mechanisms likely help increase the perception of detection and form the foundation for a holistic anti-fraud culture.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">With fraud on the rise due to the economic downturn and global pandemic, now is the time to invest in anti-fraud controls; not ignore them. Your bottom line depends on it.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">You can find more information about anti-fraud controls and so much more in the <a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2020/"">2020 <em>Report to the Nations</em></a>. </p>

220,<h1>5 Tips to Help You Pass the CFE Exam</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By Anjum Madan, CFE</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">For anyone who made a New Year’s resolution to pass the CFE Exam this year, now may be the perfect time for you to take the first necessary steps to earn the Certified Fraud Examiner credential. Sometimes the hardest part of achieving a goal is simply getting started. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I speak from experience. A year and a half ago, I participated in the <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/cfe-exam-preparation/90-day-cfe-exam-challenge"">90-Day CFE Exam Challenge</a>. Before I started the challenge, the idea of studying all of that material <em>and</em> passing the exam in three months felt way too daunting. But after going through it, I know it’s entirely possible. To help you get started, I have put together some tips that made a huge difference for me, hoping that they will help you attain your CFE in the coming months. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Tip 1: Get organized</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Create a schedule, keeping in mind your current commitments and what time of day you are best able to absorb new information. Consider waking up an hour early, devoting some time after dinner or having a designated study day during the weekend. For me, committing an hour every weekday morning worked best. If I was unable to study every day for one particular week, I would make up the time on Saturday morning. I would not do anything else until I had studied for at least five hours. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Decide how much time you want to devote, depending on how quickly you aspire to attain your CFE. Whatever your timeline is, create a list of all the steps you need to take, including taking the pre-assessment, collecting references and submitting your CFE Exam application. Assigning a date to each task ensures nothing gets missed and gives you a thrill when you can mark each one as complete. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Tip 2: Take notes</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">I cannot stress how invaluable this is! As you go through the questions in the <em><a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/cfe-exam-preparation/cfe-exam-prep---study-on-your-own-options/cfe-exam-prep-course-subscription-packages"">CFE Exam Prep Course</a></em>, keep a notebook on hand and write down the concepts that you are unsure of and where in the <em><a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/cfe-exam-preparation/cfe-exam-prep---study-on-your-own-options/fraud-examiners-manual"">Fraud Examiners Manual</a></em> they are mentioned. At the beginning of every review section, go through your notes from the previous day, reading those sections of the manual if necessary. For me, these notes were a great way to review before taking practice exams and the actual CFE Exam.</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Tip 3: Study how you learn best</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There will be sections that you struggle on more than others. For those areas especially, consider how you study best. Maybe, like me, you understand better when reading a printed page with a highlighter in hand. Or perhaps you need to hear the information, in which case you may decide to record a clip of yourself reading the section and listen to it. Do what works best for you!</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Tip 4: Use the CFE Exam Preparation group in the ACFE Community</h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The <a href=""https://connect.acfe.com/community/community-home?CommunityKey=7b91c62c-e761-41d4-8832-d253d8b44b5a"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">CFE Exam Preparation group</a> has more than 3,000 members who are currently studying for or have already completed the CFE Exam. They are a wealth of information and are happy to share their knowledge and tips. Start by searching through existing discussions in the community. You will find many CFEs have already shared what worked and didn’t work for them. Emulate what worked for them, adapt it to your own preferences and use their experiences to shape how you prepare. If you don’t find the answer to your questions, ask! Someone is sure to chime in with their insights. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Tip 5: Form a study group </h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Having a group of people who are also studying can help you stay motivated and on track. The ACFE runs a 90-Day CFE Exam Challenge three times a year. You can go ahead and sign up now, or if you don’t wait for the next one, post a message on the CFE Exam Preparation group in the community and create your own group to cheer each other on and ask questions. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">With these tips in hand, I encourage you to take the first step toward earning your CFE credential and keep on working. There is so much to learn. The process of getting my CFE led me to discover a wealth of information about both fraud prevention and myself. Good luck!</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><em>The ACFE hosts the </em><a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/cfe-exam-preparation/90-day-cfe-exam-challenge"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><em>90-Day CFE Exam Challenge</em></a><em>.

221,<h1>7 Facts You Should Know About Business Email Compromise Scams</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: Ryan Gregory, CFE</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The Better Business Bureau (BBB) International Investigations Initiative released a report titled <a href=""https://www.bbb.org/globalassets/local-bbbs/council-113/media/bbb-explosion-of-bec-scams.pdf"">“Is That Email Really From ‘The Boss’? The Explosion of Business Email Compromise (BEC) Scams”</a> this past September detailing the staggering losses that U.S. and Canadian companies have experienced due to compromised business email. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As summarized in the study, the reported losses (there are many unreported cases, per this report) show that U.S. company losses are in the billions while Canadian companies are in the tens of millions in losses. There is also a note about several Australian companies going out of business due to freight forwarding scams (<a href=""https://www.itnews.com.au/news/freight-forwarding-scam-bankrupting-aussie-it-suppliers-528626"">a type of BEC fraud</a>). </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The study highlights recent arrests made, how BEC scams are perpetrated and how companies can report to law enforcement. The study also emphasizes the need for further verification when payments are requested and emphasizes the importance of employee training to recognize these types of schemes.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In order to protect yourself and your company from a BEC attack, you should stay up to date on different tactics and techniques used by fraudsters. Here are a few key pieces of information included in the BBB report that you should know about BEC scams. </p>
<ol data-rte-list=""default"">
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Falling for the first email:</strong> BEC attacks are 10 times more likely to produce a victim if the target answers an initial probe email.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Common words and phrases:</strong> It helps to know the type of language that fraudsters will use to increase urgency and make their email sound more official. Here are some words and phrases to look out for: “request” (36%), “follow up” (14%),“urgent” or “important” (12%), and “are you available?” or “are you at your desk?” (10%).</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>The effectiveness of training:</strong> Before training, employees are 30% likely to click on a malicious link contained within a BEC email. After training, only 2% are likely to click on a link.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Lead generation use:</strong> It was found that some fraudsters used lead generation services and even signed up for free trails to obtain company and employee information, including names, email addresses and job titles. With these types of services, this information did not come from a breach nor had it been stolen. Rather, it was offered through other companies as a business service.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Cyber insurance: </strong>This report showed that while few insurance companies cover social engineering, the organizations that do have this coverage available have opted out.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Detection: </strong>It was noted that programs that are setup to detect spam email and phishing attempts are monitoring for computers that send large volumes of email and may not detect BEC attempts, as they are specifically targeted and are not usually sent out in large volumes. BEC emails often slip through the cracks because they are well-crafted and specific to the recipient.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Email domains: </strong>This study noted that a security company found domains well into the millions that were very similar to those of real companies. Setting up these domains was very simple and not expensive to create. Always closely study the domain name of an unexpected email, especially when the sender is asking for money or requesting you to take a specific action like opening a file or clicking on a link. </li>
</ol>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A review of email security settings, additional monitoring layering and accounts payable procedures can go a long way in deterring a BEC attack by those attempting to divert company funds. As the anti-fraud expert in your organization, you’ve got a huge responsibility to ensure that each person — from the new hire to the CEO — understands the potentially devastating effects of a BEC scam. Education truly is the key. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It could be the difference between moving an email to the junk folder and losing thousands of dollars.</p>

222,<h1>Beyond Checking the Boxes: Establishing a Fraud Prevention Plan</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Anti-fraud professionals know that while it’s best to catch fraud as soon as possible, it’s even better to prevent fraud before it happens — which is why active fraud prevention is a critical part of anti-fraud strategies for organizations of any size. Some organizations may still be afraid to raise the topic of fraud, believing that employees will be inspired to attempt to commit fraud, or assume that a large fraud occurred within their company. However, discussing fraud openly with employees is a proven way to help prevent it. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An ideal time to talk about fraud prevention within your organization is during International Fraud Awareness Week (Fraud Week). First established by the ACFE in 2000, Fraud Week garnered the support of more than 500 organizations from 73 countries in 2018 and continues to grow each year. During the week, supporters host educational talks in their companies, spread consumer fraud tips within their communities and even hold interdepartmental expos.  </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">For Fraud Week, take a look at the current fraud prevention plan you have in place and evaluate its effectiveness. If you don’t have an existing one, make a point to establish one and discuss its importance with stakeholders in your organization. <br/>
Here is a checklist to get you started:</p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>1. Is ongoing anti-fraud training provided to all employees of the organization?</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Anti-fraud training is critical part of fraud prevention. According to the ACFE’s 2018 <em><a href=""https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/acfepublic/2018-report-to-the-nations.pdf"">Report to the Nations</a></em>, organizations that conducted fraud training for employees saw a 41% reduction in how much money was lost per fraud instance and a 50% reduction in how long frauds continued before being discovered. Ask yourself if employees understand what constitutes fraud and if the costs of fraud — including lost profits, potential job loss and decreased productivity — have been made clear to them. Let employees know that they can speak freely without fear of retribution, and where they can go to seek advice if faced with ethical decisions. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>2. Is an effective fraud reporting mechanism in place?</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Tips are consistently shown to be the most effective way to detect fraud, representing 40% of the cases in the <em><a>Report to the Nations</a></em>. Your employees are one of your best resources for finding fraud and it’s imperative that they know how to report what they observe. An anonymous hotline is an easy way to provide a channel for reporting fraud — not only for employees, but vendors, customers and other outside parties. It's important to stress that there will not be reprisal for reporting fraud and that reports of suspicious activity will be taken seriously and evaluated thoroughly. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>3. Is the tone at the top one of honesty and integrity?</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Establishing, and sticking with, a code of conduct was shown to reduce the cost of fraud by 56% — the greatest reduction out of any fraud controls studied in the <em><a>Report to the Nations</a></em>. Employees take cues from the culture of the organization, and a company that exhibits unethical behavior in upper management is fated to have employees adopt the same attitude. Employees should be surveyed about whether or not they believe management acts with integrity and honesty. Fraud prevention goals should be incorporated into evaluation and performance measures. It’s also beneficial to have a transparent oversight of fraud risks by a board of directors or other governance body. </p>
<h2 style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>4. Is there a perception of detection publicized to employees?</strong></h2>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Fraud can flourish when employees believe they won’t be caught. Discussing and maintaining transparency about the anti-fraud controls an organization has in place is a great way to prevent fraud from occurring. Showing employees that your organization actively seeks out fraudulent conduct through surprise fraud audits, monitoring software and fraud assessments sends the message that if any fraud is occurring, it will be found. This can greatly diminish the “opportunity” portion of the Fraud Triangle. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">There are many other ways to help prevent fraud in organizations, but asking yourself and your organization these four questions is a great place to start. </p>

I’m Courtney Howell, the Community Manager at the ACFE. Today our guest is Julia Johnson. Julia is a Research Specialist here at the ACFE, and we have what I think is a very interesting topic to dig into. We’re going to be talking about three recent fraud schemes that were committed from prison. Yes, the fraudsters were operating from behind bars. First though, Julia, would you tell us a little bit about your role here at the ACFE, and also a little bit about your background?</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Julia Johnson</strong>: As Courtney said, I’m Julia Johnson, and I work in the research department for the ACFE. I focus on accounting-related fraud and subjects related to that. So, I update training materials on that topic and write different articles on emerging frauds and different fraud stories in the news. </span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""></span><span style=""color: #000000;"">Before I started at the ACFE, I worked in public accounting as an auditor. And prior to that, I worked in law enforcement for a little bit.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>CH</strong>: Awesome. All right. So, we’re going to go ahead and dig into our fraud schemes. So, the first one, let’s get into that one. It comes to us from Ohio. What was going on in this one, Julia?</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>JJ</strong>: This is actually a pretty interesting story. There were a couple inmates in Ohio that got caught for building two computers that they hid in the prison ceiling. These inmates had access to these computer parts through a program that they had at the prison where they would break down computers, old computers that people had donated to recycle. And they were given kind of lax supervision in this program, so during the times that they weren’t supervised, these prisoners would steal the parts from computers, build their own computers, and then they were able to connect these homemade prison computers to the network and access all sorts of sensitive information and even the internet. They were able to access this by using the stolen credentials of one of their supervisors, who was in charge of watching them.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">When they were finally caught, the prosecutor’s office did a full investigation and checked out the hard drive and what was happening. They realized that these prisoners were able to issue passes to gain access to different areas within the prison that they normally would not have been allowed. They were able to access inmate records, which contained sentencing information, social security numbers, lots of sensitive information that you really don’t want anyone, including a prisoner, getting ahold of. </span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">They researched how to commit tax refund fraud using just a few elements, like social security numbers, date of birth and bank account information. They also applied for debit and credit cards using other inmates’ identities. There was an app that they could also use to communicate with parties outside of jail. </span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">They also loaded movies and other media on thumb drives that they would sell to other prisoners in exchange for items that they could buy at the commissary. </span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>CH</strong>: So how did they steal the supervisor’s log in? How did they get ahold of that information?</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>JJ</strong>: During the investigation, the prosecutor’s office found one of the prisoners confessed to shoulder-surfing the supervisor, so just looking over his shoulder and seeing what he was typing, and the next day went in and used the same log in, and it worked just fine.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>CH</strong>: Simple, yet effective.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>JJ</strong>: Yes.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>CH</strong>: Okay. So, they were committing, you said, false tax return fraud and then also credit card fraud?</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>JJ</strong>: Yes.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>CH</strong>: They were stealing people’s identities. Did the other prisoners know they were using their identities? Or were they just stealing them from the records that they uncovered?</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>JJ</strong>: They stole one prisoner’s identity, and when he was questioned, he was not aware at all that this was happening. When they asked the prisoner who was doing the theft why [this other prisoner] was chosen, he said he picked this specific prisoner because he was young and had a long prison sentence, so he knew that he wasn’t going to get out for a long time and that he would probably get away with it.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>CH</strong>: Interesting. What are some controls that were maybe lacking at the prison? How could they have prevented this or even just caught it sooner?</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>JJ</strong>: Yeah, I mean, there’s definitely a few things that could have been done to prevent this or catch it a lot sooner. One thing that they could have done is have proper oversight over the prisoners that were doing the work. The supervisor left them unattended for long periods of time, which gave them the opportunity to build these computers. So, I think proper supervision was definitely something that was lacking.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Another thing would be to maintain inventory records. So those computers that they were receiving, the donated computers, they should have been keeping inventory of the parts that were going in and out. They would have noticed that there was a lot more coming in than were coming out.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Also, a big one is to just protect your password. Know your surroundings. Update your password frequently so that if someone were to get ahold of it, it wouldn’t be there for too long.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>CH</strong>: After they discovered that this was happening, how were they caught?</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>JJ</strong>: The prisoners were caught because the network system at the prison alerted the technical department that the internet usage had reached its maximum for the day. They thought it was kind of weird because it was using some credentials that didn’t work on the weekends, and this took place on a weekend. So that raised a red flag. They went to check it out and found these two computers in the ceiling.</span></p>
<p style=""color: #777777; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 24px 0px; line-height: 1.6em;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">They actually had two of the inmates take the computers down and put them in a supervisor’s office. So, the investigative process was not handled very well. I think they had the perpetrators taking them down. One thing that could have definitely been done to protect that is just putting specific policies and procedures in place for — I mean, obviously this isn’t a situation that you would have in a “code of conduct” type book — but just having specific procedures for handling suspected misconduct and things of that nature so that the investigative process can be as solid as it can be.</span></p>

224,<h1>What Is Benford's Law and Why Do Fraud Examiners Use It?</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">John Gill,  J.D., CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Benford’s Law can be a tricky concept to grasp at first. Here are the basic things to remember:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It relies on the idea that the distribution of digits in multi-digit natural numbers is not random; instead, it follows a predictable pattern. More on that later.</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It applies only to “natural numbers.” The definition for natural numbers and non-natural numbers in a fraud examination are different than they are in math, so don’t let that throw you off. Here’s how we define them for Benford’s Law.<em></em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style=""white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 40px;""><em></em><em>Natural numbers </em>are those numbers that are not ordered in a particular numbering scheme and are not human-generated or generated from a random number system.</li>
<li style=""white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 40px;""><em>Non-natural numbers</em> are designed systematically to convey information that restricts the natural nature of the number (e.g., postal codes and telephone numbers).</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=""Benford's Law Figure A"" class=""contentDescription"" longdesc=""Figure A"" src=""-/media/d0e5e8370b944e95bb6598311d238858.ashx?h=500&amp;w=300&amp;hash=78A4056F7541738D78918FDA0F4112F8"" style=""white-space-collapse: preserve; height: 500px; width: 300px; float: left;"" title=""Figure A""/>
</p>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap; margin-left: 320px; text-align: left;"">Let’s say you have a three-digit payment amount ($XXX). What are the odds that the first digit would be 3? Well, you might think the odds are 1 in 9. In other words, there is an equal chance that the first digit would be 1 or 2 or 3, etc., up to 9.<br/>
Benford’s Law says that the odds are not random. In fact, there is a 12.5% chance the first digit will be a 3. There is a 30.1% chance the first digit will be a 1.<br/>
Fraud examiners use Benford’s Law tests on natural numbers, like payment amounts. The theory is that if a fraudster submits fake invoices for payment, he won’t submit invoices for $100 or $200, he will want to go big and submit invoices for $900 or $800. If you do that enough times, it upsets the natural order of the way numbers should occur (according to Benford). For example, if you run a Benford’s Law test on your April payments, and you find the first digit was 9 in 35% of the payments, that’s an anomaly. Bendford’s Law says 9 should be the first digit only 4.6% of the time. <br/>
No test is foolproof, but Benford’s Law does provide an extra method for fraud examiners to test data for potentially fraudulent activity.

225,<h1>Health Care Fraud: 5 Common Billing Schemes</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Ron Cresswell,  J.D., CFE</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap;"">According to the <a href=""https://www.nhcaa.org/tools-insights/about-health-care-fraud/the-challenge-of-health-care-fraud/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association</a>, the U.S. loses tens of billions of dollars each year to health care fraud. Most health care fraud is committed by providers, such as physicians and hospitals, and much of that fraud involves fraudulent billing. This post discusses five common billing schemes, and how to detect and prevent them.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space: pre-wrap;""><strong>1. Upcoding</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap;"">When a provider submits a bill to the government or a private insurer, the provider also includes medical codes to identify the medical services provided. These medical codes are used to determine the amount of the provider’s reimbursement. In upcoding schemes, a provider intentionally submits an incorrect medical code for a higher level of service than actually rendered. For example, a hospital might administer a generic drug but bill the government for the more expensive, brand-name version of the drug.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space: pre-wrap;""><strong>2. Unbundling</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap;"">Medical procedures often have special reimbursement rates for groups of procedures that are typically performed together. Some providers try to increase profits by billing separately for procedures that are part of a single procedure. This is called unbundling. For instance, instead of submitting the single bundled medical code for “appendectomy,” a provider might submit different codes for all of the component parts of the procedure (e.g., incision, appendix removal, closing up the patient).</p>
<h3 style=""white-space: pre-wrap;""><strong>3. Double Billing</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap;"">In a<em> </em>double billing scheme, a provider bills multiple times for the same medical services. Sometimes providers bill the same party (e.g., the government) multiple times for the same services. To avoid detection, they can alter the date of the service, its description, or the name of the patient or provider. Alternatively, providers can bill multiple parties (e.g., the government and a private insurer) for the same services. </p>
<h3 style=""white-space: pre-wrap;""><strong>4. Billing for Fictitious Services</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap;"">In a fictitious services scheme, a provider bills for medical services that were not rendered or items that were not furnished. Fictitious services schemes can involve real patients or fake patients. Providers create fake patients by stealing or purchasing the personal information of real people, falsely listing them as patients, and billing for fictitious services provided to them.</p>
<h3 style=""white-space: pre-wrap;""><strong>5. Billing for Non-Covered Services</strong></h3>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap;""><strong></strong>Non-covered services are medical services that are not reimbursable by the government or private insurance. Providers often attempt to obtain reimbursement for non-covered services by fraudulently labeling them as covered services. For example, a surgeon performs a nose job (a non-covered, cosmetic procedure) but bills the government for repairing the patient’s deviated septum (a covered procedure).</p>
<h4><strong>Detection and Prevention</strong></h4>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap;"">Patients can detect billing schemes by carefully reviewing any explanation of benefits (EOB) notices they receive. If there are unrecognized procedures or charges on an EOB, patients should contact their insurer or provider immediately. </p>
<p style=""white-space: pre-wrap;"">Providers can prevent billing schemes by hiring experienced professionals to conduct billing functions and performing regular audits of billing procedures and records. Additionally, all bills should be compared with the corresponding medical records before they are submitted for reimbursement.</p>

226,<h1>A Framework for Effective Fraud Risk Management</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">John Thackeray </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>There are now more reasons than ever to implement an effective fraud risk management framework for personnel in your organization. The focus on individual responsibility has dramatically altered and employees should now be educated as to the risks and repercussions, especially in the U.S. As a result of the memorandum titled “Individual Accountability for Corporate Wrongdoing” issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General (DAG) Sally Yates on September 9, 2015 — even those who merely had knowledge that something wrong was happening but didn’t report it would potentially face penalties.</p>
<p>Known simply as the “Yates Memo,” the directive signals the new priority in the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) pursuit of corporate wrongdoing — a priority of pursuing, punishing and deterring individual wrongdoers versus the corporation itself. According to the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) annual report, issuer reporting and disclosure cases represented 20% of the SEC’s 2017 enforcement actions — the largest proportion in many years. </p>
<p>What should an individual do when they suspect fraud or unethical behavior?</p>
<p>First, document, document and document! Keep detailed and precise records about what you are asked to do, who asked you to do it and what you did. Make sure that the records are easy to find, with clear evidence of date, time and author. Second, report your concerns through an independent, anonymous hotline or to a board member. In many cases, whistleblowers are provided meaningful protection from reprisal, and they may even be eligible for a financial reward for providing useful information to law enforcement.</p>
<p>But what can you do to prevent fraud from happening in the first place? The considerations raised above should be incorporated into a five-stage risk management framework outlined below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify your fraud risk appetite. Design a written statement and convert into a risk-tolerance limit. A risk-tolerance limit is a quantifiable amount which is the maximum that the organization is willing to lose and is a translation of the risk appetite statement into a number. The determination of the amount is based on factors including previous history, the firm’s appetite and attitude.</li>
<li>Ensure that the organizational culture and structure is conducive and open to fraud risk management. Create a structure with a dedicated entity, department or person to lead all fraud risk management activities.</li>
<li>Plan regular fraud risk assessments and assess risks to determine a fraud risk profile. </li>
<li>Design and implement a fraud hotline or reporting system. As part of managing the hotline, determine risk responses and document an anti-fraud strategy based on your fraud risk profile and develop a plan outlining how you will respond to identified instances of fraud. Remember to engage with stakeholders on a frequent basis with updates.</li>
<li>Conduct risk-based monitoring and evaluate all components of the fraud risk management framework. Focus on measuring outcomes and communicate the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fraud is pervasive, and there are risks to an organization both internally and externally. It can be seen as a symptom of an organization’s culture, and in that sense, it requires the highest sense of vigilance to ensure that it does not become endemic.</p>

227,<h1>Top 8 Concealment Methods Used by Fraudsters</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">ACFE Staff  </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">An act of fraud rarely occurs without subsequent acts to hide it. In the time after a fraud takes place, perpetrators are working in multiple ways to either circumvent controls or take advantage of a lack of controls.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The median duration for all of the fraud cases in the ACFE's 2018 <em>Report to the Nations</em> was 16 months, and frauds that last over 60 months are more than 20 times as costly as those that are caught in the first six months. The data also indicates that fraudsters tend to start small and increase their frauds rapidly over the first three years. Thus, it is incredibly important for organizations to implement proactive fraud detection mechanisms to catch frauds quickly and minimize their damage. One way to do this is by deterring and managing the ways people can hide their frauds.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><img alt=""Infographic detailing concealment methods of fraudsters, 2018 Report to the Nations"" src=""-/media/34cdd35eab63448dbaa5184133954f1c.ashx"" style=""height:423px; width:830px;""/></p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As we all know, an act of fraud typically involves not only the commission of the scheme itself, but also efforts to conceal the misdeeds. Knowing what those efforts look like is crucial to proactively monitoring the possible areas where the concealment of fraud can occur.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">As the report found, the top eight concealment methods used by fraudsters that anti-fraud professionals should be aware of are:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Created fraudulent physical documents; 55%</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Altered physical documents; 48%</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Created fraudulent transactions in the accounting system; 42%</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Altered transactions in the accounting system; 34%</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Altered electronic documents or files; 31%</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Destroyed physical documents; 30%</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Created fraudulent electronic documents or files; 29%</li>
<li style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Created fraudulent journal entries; 27%</li>
</ol>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Understanding the methods fraudsters use to cover their crimes can help organizations better design prevention mechanisms and detect the warning signs of fraud. This also illustrates the importance of implementing internal controls like the segregation of duties, a chain of command of documents that is strictly followed and regular reviews or audits of processes.</p>

228,<h1>You Discovered Fraud — Now What? 5 Steps to Take After Suspecting Fraud in Your Company</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Kelly Todd,  CPA/ABV</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p>By: <span style=""color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;"">Kelly Todd, CFE</span></p>
<p>Despite efforts to prevent fraud, the unfortunate reality is that it still happens — in fact, according to the ACFE's 2022 <em><a href=""https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2022/"">Report to the Nations</a></em>, it is estimated that companies lose 5% of revenue each year to fraud. If you suspect fraud has occurred at your organization, take these immediate action steps:</p>
<h3>1. Safeguard potential evidence</h3>
<p>Preservation of evidence is key. Secure any and all potential evidence — but by all means, avoid the temptation to examine the evidence on your own. Electronic evidence is fragile and easily altered. Did you know that simply turning a computer off or on can alter potential evidence? Secure computers, cellphones and external electronic media sources such as thumb drives. Maintaining the evidence will help your forensic accounting team identify what occurred, who committed the fraud and why.</p>
<h3>2. Gather a team</h3>
<p>Enlist a forensic accountant and computer forensic specialist to help you collect, analyze and store the data. It would be wise to hire an outside financial investigator who is familiar with and experienced in fraud investigations — using an in-house accountant is not appropriate, as they are not as objective as an outside source. In fact, someone on the accounting team may be part of the problem. Retain an employment lawyer to ensure you stay on the right side of the law regarding the rights of the suspected employee.</p>
<h3>3. Deal with the suspected employee</h3>
<p>Don’t fire the suspected employee immediately — it could make gathering evidence much more difficult. Instead, restrict their access to company data. Do not let them remove their computer or any other company items and documents from their office.</p>
<h3>4. Notify your insurance provider</h3>
<p>A crucial fact for employers to know is that you must notify your insurance provider within 30 to 60 days, depending on your policy. Failure to do so could cause a loss of coverage.</p>
<h3>5. File proof of loss</h3>
<p>You will need to document any losses with your insurance provider in a specified time frame. Documenting a claim with an insurance provider takes time to ensure it is properly recorded. It is possible to file an extension should you need one, but be sure not to miss any deadlines or you risk forfeiting coverage.</p>
<p>The best way to mitigate fraud risks is to have internal controls and external resources available to prevent them from happening in the first place. Should fraud occur, the initial steps you take in addressing suspected fraud can hinder or greatly help your efforts — don’t make the mistake of collecting evidence and acting without the assistance of a team of forensic specialists and legal professionals.</p>

229,<h1>5 Ways to Mitigate Fraud Risk</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Kelly Todd,  CPA/ABV</h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in;"">The growing abundance of internal and external threats can make it difficult to stay ahead of fraudsters. While fraud itself hasn’t changed all that much in recent years, the risks continue to grow in both size and complexity as technology changes and the ability to move, share and expose corporate assets becomes easier.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in;"">In today’s technology-crazed age, the scope of risk is growing, and businesses that do not keep up with evolving threats will be vulnerable. Here are some tips on how to keep up:</p>
<h2>1. Monitor your data</h2>
<p>In the past, this meant monitoring transactional data to proactively identify anomalies indicative of fraud. Now, however, fraud can be committed in a variety of ways, including uploading sensitive data to the “cloud,” emailing company information, and saving sensitive information on a smartphone or sharing via social media. It’s essential to safeguard your company’s information to ensure it is not shared outside of your business in a malicious manner. Monitoring technology that promptly notifies you when company data is leaving the office, or when shared online, is readily available. Talk with your data security professional for the appropriate solution to monitor and secure your sensitive data.</p>
<h2>2. Establish proactive communication with employees around fraud</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Educate your employees on what is and is not appropriate regarding the use of company technology and handling of company information. Establish policies that define the expectation of privacy and your company’s right to monitor network activity. Hold regular training on fraud and ethical behavior in the workplace and establish a chain of command in dealing with suspected fraudulent activity so that your employees are well-equipped to deal with any ethical dilemmas.</p>
<h2>3. Implement company policies on confidentiality and nondisclosure</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Upon hiring, employees should be given information on confidentiality policies they must sign and agree to. If your current employees were not subjected to these agreements upon their hiring, implement the policies and require each of your employees to consent. If an employee violates the company policy, they should know that there will be consequences. If an employee leaves the organization, enforce agreed-upon nondisclosure terms.</p>
<h2>4. Set up a whistleblower hotline</h2>
<p>Most frauds are discovered by tip or by accident, according to the 2016 <em>ACFE Report to the Nations</em>. It is important that employees work in an environment where they feel they can speak up if they see wrongdoing. Whistleblower hotlines often generate a wide range of reports – implement a few guiding principles around the type of matters that get reported to the audit committee, including significant deficiencies in internal control, senior management malfeasance, accounting irregularities, theft and financial losses, and broad deviations from the organizations anti-fraud policies.</p>
<h2>5. Hire the right people</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Mitigate fraud risks by preventing nefarious actors from gaining access to your data in the first place.<strong> </strong>A thorough vetting of new hires remains critical. All too often, the unfounded belief a former employer won’t share anything of value keeps references from being checked – but if you don’t ask, you will never know.  Pick up the phone and check those references.</p>
<p>Internal controls have been the standard to prevent fraud in the workplace, but as the landscape becomes more multifaceted, new measures like the ones above are necessary.</p>
<p>Despite efforts to prevent fraud, the unfortunate reality is that it still happens.</p>

230,<h1>Infamous Fraud Cases of the 21st Century</h1>,"<h5 class=""margin-top-1"">Guest Blogger </h5>","<div class=""cell large-8"">
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">By: ACFE Staff</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">A seemingly endless stream of fraud stories hits the headlines every day. On Monday you could read that an Ivy league-educated financier defrauded his victims of more than $38 million and by Friday, a European soccer star is spending his day in court.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">It can be disheartening to see these stories splayed across your computer or TV screens. There is, however, a silver lining. If we’ve learned anything from taking history classes in school it’s that understanding the past helps to avoid repeating it. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">In a new ACFE online self-study course, <a href=""https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/all-products/product-detail-page?s=10-Infamous-Fraud-Cases-of-the-21st-Century"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><em>10 Infamous Fraud Cases of the 21st Century</em></a>, we do just that. By exploring 10 notable fraud cases of the 21st century, fraud examiners can identify the methods the major players used to conduct their schemes, and analyze the aftermath and impacts of various frauds. Learning from past cases means you can help protect your clients, employers and the general public from similar schemes in the future.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>WorldCom</strong><br/>
In 2002, the WorldCom scandal became one of the largest accounting frauds in history when the company revealed its wrongdoing and was subsequently forced to file bankruptcy and write off $50 billion in losses. The scandal began when WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers employed a business strategy of achieving growth through acquisitions. He acquired MCI Communications and then proposed a merger with Sprint but was forced to abandon the Sprint merger in 2000. Determined to show increased revenue despite a slow-down in mergers and acquisitions, Ebbers manipulated the books to satisfy Wall Street’s expectations. The scheme was detected when a capital expenditures audit revealed suspicious journal entries. WorldCom’s internal audit team discovered improper accounting in expenses over five quarters. The WorldCom accounting scandal was a situation in which corporate governance failed and the board of directors were caught unaware. WorldCom’s accounting system was faulty and Ebbers’ close relationship with external accounting firm Arthur Andersen presented a conflict of interest in which the auditors were unable to exercise professional skepticism when performing their audits.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>FIFA</strong><br/>
High-profile sports are big business in many countries. Unfortunately for the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), alleged corruption and money laundering means its big business operated with little or no oversight. The FIFA scandal involved the collusion between FIFA executives, sports marketing executives and officials of continental football bodies. The scandal erupted in May 2015 when Swiss authorities raided a hotel in Zurich and several FIFA executives were arrested. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has cited more than 40 defendants in the FIFA scandal. Some charges involved bids for World Cups and for marketing and broadcast deals that amounted to nearly $150 million. Future World Cups are now in question — the scandal has caused the bidding process for the 2026 World Cup to be suspended. Proposed changes have been made, but only time will tell in an organization that has historically dealt with bribery and corruption.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong><br/>
In 2012, British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was at the center of the largest health care fraud settlement in history when the company agreed to pay $3 billion in fines to U.S. regulators. The crime? According to the U.S. Justice Department, GSK unlawfully promoted certain prescription drugs, failed to report safety data, paid kickbacks to health care professionals and engaged in fraudulent pricing practices. The settlement arose from a number of GSK policies and practices that largely involved the promotion of prescription drugs, like Paxil and Wellbutrin, for off-label use. While doctors may prescribe drugs for off-label use, it’s illegal for pharmaceutical companies to promote or market off-label uses. The U.S. government also claimed that GSK paid unlawful kickbacks to health care professionals to encourage them to prescribe certain drugs. Although much of GSK’s misconduct was unique to the pharmaceutical and health care industries, the case contains broad lessons. A company’s culture should stress compliance and ethical conduct. The nature and prevalence of GSK’s misconduct suggest that its culture rewarded profit rather than compliance and patient safety. That type of culture is a recipe for fraud. </p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Target</strong><br/>
The Target data breach in late 2013 was the largest in U.S. retail history and resulted in the exposure of approximately 40 million credit card numbers and the personal information of 70 million customers. Unidentified hackers — thought to be from Eastern Europe or Russia — surreptitiously installed malware into Target’s computer networks. The hackers accessed Target’s systems using the credentials of a third-party heating and air conditioning contractor.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">Before the company was hacked, Target had installed a security system that caught five instances of malware graded at the highest severity. Members of corporate headquarters were notified, but apparently ignored the alerts. In this day and age when cybersecurity has become a hot topic thanks to the increasing advancements in technology, the Target debacle shows that companies need a strong response plan to deal with alerts of possible network intrusions.</p>
<p style=""white-space:pre-wrap;""><strong>Olympus</strong><br/>
The Olympus financial scandal exploded in late 2011 when then president and CEO Michael Woodford came forward with information exposing fraudulent accounting practices in the organization. Woodford had only served as CEO for two weeks when he revealed the financial malfeasance. The fraud is one of the most significant corporate corruption scandals in the history of Japan. In 2000, standards in Japan changed significantly after the failure of Yamaguchi Securities in 1997. The new accounting standards required losses on certain assets to be noted at the end of each accounting period. Rather than comply with the standards and disclose mounting losses, Olympus constructed a complicated system of hiding its bad assets. The company began selling bad assets for exorbitant prices to newly created entities under its control without recognizing losses from the sales. The Olympus fraud shows that tone at the top matters. Woodford wrote letters to the board about his concerns and was subsequently fired. This exemplified the company’s unethical culture. C-level executives must act according to the principles expected of employees at all levels and across the enterprise.</p>
