# dtsc-3602-proj
Fraud research project for DTSC-3602

Fraud Article Scraping & Analysis Project
Overview

This project focuses on scraping fraud-related articles from the ACFE Insights Blog, classifying them using targeted fraud-related keywords, storing the results in a structured dataset, and analyzing fraud trends through visualizations and statistical summaries.
The final pipeline automates scraping → filtering → storing → analyzing → visualizing.

This repository contains all code, documentation, images, and outputs created throughout the project.

Technologies Used

Python (BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas, Matplotlib)

Supabase (backend storage)

NLTK / TextBlob (sentiment scoring)

WordCloud (keyword visualization)

Git & GitHub (collaboration and version control)


Project Objectives

Scrape fraud-related articles from the ACFE Insights Blog.

Store scraped data in a structured format (pandas DataFrame, CSV, Supabase).

Classify articles using a refined set of fraud-related keywords.

Identify common themes and fraud trends.

Generate visualizations summarizing fraud activity.

Build a complete and reusable pipeline for future fraud analysis.


Dataset Summary

After refining our keyword search to reduce noise, we collected 102 high-relevance articles using keywords such as:

Scam, Embezzlement, Fraud investigation, Bribery, Money laundering, 


Each article record includes: Title, Full text, Matching keywords, Category (Financial / General Fraud), Sentiment score, Metadata (URL, scrape date), Key Findings, Keyword Frequency



Top five fraud-related terms:

Scam, Embezzlement, Fraud Investigation, Money Laundering, Bribery


These dominated the narrative across ACFE posts.

Fraud Category Distribution

30% of articles: Financial Fraud (embezzlement, bribery, money laundering)

70% of articles: General or Other Fraud (phishing, identity theft, charity fraud, scams)

Sentiment 


A histogram of polarity values revealed:

Most articles are neutral to slightly positive, due to factual reporting style

A smaller portion are negative, reflecting the severity of fraud cases


Emerging Trends

Rise in scam-based fraud (phishing, text scams).

Corporate and internal fraud remains consistently reported.

Consumer-level fraud dominates the "general fraud" category.


Visualizations

Stored in /outputs or /images, including:

Word Cloud of most frequent terms, 
Keyword Frequency Histogram, 
Fraud Category Distribution Plot, 
Sentiment Distribution Histogram


Trend Breakdown Charts

Each image is automatically generated and saved during the pipeline run.

Pipeline Workflow
1. Scrape

Pulls ACFE articles using Requests + BeautifulSoup.

2. Filter

Identifies relevant articles using the refined keyword list.

3. Store

Saves data to:

pandas DataFrame

CSV files

Supabase database

4. Analyze

Calculates:

Keyword frequency

Sentiment polarity

Fraud categories

5. Visualize

Outputs multiple PNG charts for presentation use.
